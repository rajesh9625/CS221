Search Engine for UCI ICS domain

The project involves crawling content on ics.uci.edu domain using crawler4j and building an inverted index over the data. Ranking the results on the basis of term frequency, inverse document frequency, HTML tags, URL data and length, and finally building a UI to query the terms over the domain and display the results according to rank.
