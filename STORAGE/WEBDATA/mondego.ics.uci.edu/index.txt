  Graduate School?
  I am always looking for good, highly-motivated individuals who
  have what it takes to spend 5-6 years diving into a specific problem
  in my areas of interest. If you are interested in working with me
  and the students in the Mondego Group, consider applying to one of these
  Ph.D. programs in the Bren School of ICS:
  Software
  Engineering: choose this if your main interest is the
  production of software systems. Work that I advise under this
  program includes: software architectures for large-scale systems,
  mining software repositories, programming languages and
  environments. In other words, the server side and development tools.
  Informatics:
  choose this if your main interest is HCI. Work that I advise
  under this program includes: user experience for 3D spaces,
  virtual-physical interaction. In other words, the front end.
  Computer
  Science: choose this if your main interests are Web data or
  scientific data. Work that I advise under this program includes:
  mining the Web, analyzing large scientific data
  sets. In other words, the data side.
