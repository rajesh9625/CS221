CRADL is a research group led by Prof. David Redmiles that employs an interdisciplinary approach to research phenomena in human collaborative activity. We primarily study collaborative work, and, particularly, software engineering.
The acronym CRADL stands for Collaboration Research in Action, Design, and Learning. Our research focus is on collaboration. The themes of action, design, and learning have various inspirations and meanings. In a simplistic sense, people act in the world. In so doing, they cause or achieve changes and designs. Actions do not always succeed and designs often fail. Reflection leads to learning. Our work is inspired by, among others, Schoen’s concept of reflection in action, the centrality of activity in the work by activity theorists such as Engestrom, Kuuti, et al., the science of design work such as by Simon and Fischer, and intelligent tutoring research by Anderson.
