Equity & Diversity




Message from the ICS equity advisor 

The UC Irvine campus is committed to supporting gender equity and diversity. There has never been a more important time to consider diversity in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields. The field of computer science is changing rapidly, and an academic body with a diverse background can contribute unique ideas and perspectives to the creative development and study of new technologies for a global world. One of the ways we can achieve a more inclusive climate is to educate ourselves on the importance of diversity in our field. To this end, I will use this site to assemble articles that relate to issues concerning women and underrepresented minorities regarding educational achievement, advancement, pay inequity and other topics. If you have any questions regarding our equity program, or if you'd like to suggest articles for posting on this site, please send a message to advance@ics.uci.edu.

I hope you enjoy learning more about this important topic as I have. 


Your ICS equity advisor,Gloria Mark
