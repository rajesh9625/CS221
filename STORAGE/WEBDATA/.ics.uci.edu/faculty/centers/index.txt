ICS Research Centers





Organized research programs provide a mechanism and organizational structure within which collective research activities can take place that are fundamentally different from those that occur normally within the schools and departments. They are intended to foster the development of short- and long-term research programs that span disciplines and academic units, thereby making it possible for faculty to acquire extramural resources for which they might not otherwise qualify. The following is a list of the research centers that are part of ICS:
ABRC - Ada Byron Research Center  ABRC studies and promotes diverse access to and participation in computer science, engineering, digital media and related information technology fields.
Calit2 - California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology  A multidisciplinary research institute in collaboration with UCSD, Calit2@UCI integrates academic research with industry experience to seek innovative IT approaches that will benefit society and ignite economic development.
CDT - Center for Digital TransformationOne of the world's leading think tanks on the impact of information technology on organizations and society and on the management of information technology.
Center for Algorithms and Theory of Computation  The goal of research in theoretical computer science is to produce results, supported by rigorous proof, about problems dealing with computers and their applications.
Center for Embedded Computer Systems  Conducting leading-edge interdisciplinary research in embedded systems, the center develops innovative design methodologies, and promote technology and knowledge transfer for the benefit of the individual and society.
Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems  Addresses the challenges of the modern data-driven world, using computer algorithms to discover useful information from vast data archives.
 
Center for Social ComputingConducts foundational research into the relationship between information technology and society. Based at UCI, the center brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers from leading U.S. universities.
 
CERT - Center for Emergency Response Technologies  Works to radically transform the ability of responding organizations to gather, manage, use, and disseminate information within emergency response networks and to the general public. By using more robust information systems, response can focus on activities that have the highest potential to save lives and property.
COR - Center for Organizational Research  COR contributes to the development of organization theory by connecting scholars from many disciplines who bring their knowledge and methods to a common understanding of these issues.
CPCC - Center for Pervasive Communications and Computing  Dedicated to serving the vision of wearable computers with wireless connections that enable anyone to have continuous voice, video, and data connectivity.
Computational Vision Lab The Computational Vision Lab focuses on understanding the information processing capabilities of biological visual systems and on developing computational systems for processing visual media.
IGB - Institute for Genomics and BioInformatics  Fostering innovative basic and applied research in genomics and BioInformatics, IGB works with established companies, start-ups, government agencies and standards bodies to develop and transition these technologies to widespread and practical application.
ISR - Institute for Software Research  Works toward advancing software and information technology through research partnerships and educating the next generation of software researchers and practitioners in advanced software technologies.
 
IVECG - Institute for Virtual Environments and Computer Games Brings together researchers for the common goal of understanding and creating technology and applications that transform how we: see the world through immersive visualization and virtual tours; interact and socialize with global communities; communicate and collaborate with colleagues in virtual collaborative space; provide medical care and training to remote corners of the world; and educate all ages and populations using virtual environments.
 
LUCI - Laboratory for Ubiquitous Computing and Interaction  Addresses the entire range of research problems that arise from the ubiquitous computing vision: the design of novel devices, the structure of software systems, techniques for designing and building systems, patterns of interaction, and the cultural implications of ubiquitous computing.
Secure Systems and Software Laboratory  The Secure Systems and Software Laboratory at the University of California, Irvine.
SCONCE - Secure Computing and Networking Center   SCONCE focuses on research for protecting information and computing infrastructure with an emphasis in areas like applied cryptography, network security and information assurance.
