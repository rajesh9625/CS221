Undergraduate Student Policies




Laptop Requirement and Computer Use
Beginning in Fall 2014, students enrolling in ICS 31/CSE 41, ICS 32/CSE 42, and ICS 33/CSE 43 are required to own a personal
laptop for coursework. 
» If You're Planning to Get a New Laptop
Students receiving financial aid in the fall can request an additional
one-time budget increase of up to $2,000 for a new computer. The additional
funding available is limited to student and/or parent loans, depending on
eligibility and borrowing limits. This
allowance covers hardware, software, monitor, printer, and extended warranty.
Students
are encouraged to visit or contact the Office of Financial Aid and
Scholarships, 102 Aldrich Hall, by email at finaid@uci.edu, or phone at (949)
824-8262, for details on the budget increase process and limitations.
» Recommended Computer Specifications
RAM: 4 GB or higherHard drive: 250 GB or more Processor: Intel Core i5 or i7, or similar AMDWeight: Students are expected to bring their laptops to
class so please consider weight if this is a factor for you.Screen: When writing/debugging programs, more screen
space tends to be very useful.Warranty: Extended hardware warranty is recommended.

*If you have a laptop that was purchased within the last 4
years, the system should be adequate for lower division work. Your computer should be running an operating
system which will receive security updates and should be minimum 2 GB of RAM
and have sufficient hard drive space to install required programs. 
**Recommended, but not required:

available throughout campus; nominal fee to print)
