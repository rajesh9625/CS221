Undergraduate Student Policies




Taking Courses Outside of UCI 
Continuing Bren School students may petition to take up to four approved, UC-transferable, lower-division
courses—excepting writing classes—at a community college or other
university. 
 

 
» Finding Transferable Courses
Consult www.assist.org to find courses that are
UC-transferable.
It is extremely important to consult with a Bren School
academic counselor prior to taking off-campus courses, and especially if you
are near or in your last year prior to graduation.
A counselor will
review your list of proposed courses to:
ensure that they will count towards your general education or major requirementsensure that students do not compromise your ability to meet the UCI
residence requirement.
 
» Transferring Credit
Students must submit an official transcript in order to have any course taken outside of UCI applied to their degree audit.  
For courses taken at another 2- or 4-year institution, send official transcripts to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools.
For courses taken through UCI Extension or Access UCI, send transcripts to the Office of the Registrar.
Note: If you are a graduating senior, it is strongly recommended that you submit your transcripts as soon as grades are posted, and inform the appropriate the appropriate office(s) of that submission.
