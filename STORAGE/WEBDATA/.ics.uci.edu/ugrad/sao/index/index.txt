Academic Advising




It is the student's responsibility to make decisions about his/her
educational and career goals.
Academic counselors are here to help students work towards those goals,
and academic advising is an intentional partnership between the student and
his/her advisor(s) in which the shared goal is the student’s academic
success. 
Below is information on when, why, and how often to see academic advising, whether you come during walk-in hours or for an appointment.
 

 
» Meet with an Academic Advisor
Whenever you have a question about your academic standing, progress, or goalsOnce a quarter, or at least once a year, to make sure you are on trackThree quarters before your intended graduation date
 
» Some Benefits of Consistent Academic Advising Meetings
Be confident that you are on track for graduationReceive assistance with short- and long-term goal settingGet help with planning and selecting courses to meet your academic and career goalsObtain referrals to and advice about campus resources and
opportunitiesGain clarification on University and School policies and procedures
 
» While Meeting with an Advisor
Arrive on time (if meeting during a scheduled appointment)Come prepared with questions and concernsHonestly discuss your goals, interests, and prioritiesKeep an open mind to consider the options presented to youDon’t be afraid to ask questions if you don't understand something
 
» What it is a Study Plan, and Why Should You Have One?
A Study Plan maps out of the courses and/or units you would need
to take in the upcoming academic year(s) in order to make progress on your
degree requirements.
It presents a bird's eye view of your course load and potential
academic commitments over the yearIt allows you to make quick adjustments to your schedule and plan aheadIt can help reduce stress when enrolling for classes 
 
» Tips for Building a Study Plan
Know what classes you need to take. These include courses that
satisfy University and School Requirements, as well as any core courses
required for your major.Make special note of any required classes that are only offered once
a year or once every other year, or must be taken in a specific order.Pay attention to course prerequisites, and know which ones you have
cleared. If you need to submit a prerequisite clearing request, take care of it
in advance. Use the tentative academic year course plan when mapping out your
year. But keep in mind that this course plan is tentative, so some of the
elective classes you were hoping to take may be cancelled or conflict with each
other. Be prepared to be flexible!
