 Butterworth Product Development Competition at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences  Is a product development competition designed to encourage the creation of new technologies with potential for commercialization. Ideas and products are evaluated on their technological merits and potential to impact the marketplace. Students are encouraged to submit new products that involve the development of software and systems. Products that entail integration are acceptable as long as there is a substantial development effort.
The competition is open to all UCI students. Teams must be composed of at least two (2) students, one (1) of which must be enrolled at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences.
Beall Student Design Competition at The Henry Samueli School of Engineering  Offered to encourage the creation of new technologies, or solutions to current design problems that have the potential for commercialization. Ideas and products are evaluated on their technological merits as well as potential to impact the marketplace. Students are encouraged to submit new product ideas that involve the development of hardware and devices. Products that entail integration are acceptable as long as there is a substantial development effort.
The competition is open to all UCI students. Teams must be composed of at least two (2) students, one (1) of which must be enrolled at The Henry Samueli School of Engineering.
