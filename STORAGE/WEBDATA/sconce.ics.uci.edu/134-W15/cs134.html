  Instructor: Gene Tsudik 
  
  
  Description: 
  Overview of modern cryptography; security threats and counter measures;
  secret and public key cryptography; digital signatures and non-repudiation;
  cryptographic strength; block ciphers and stream ciphers; 
  Computer and network security; data privacy and data integrity;
  authentication and identification; freshness and timeliness; hostile traffic
  analysis; protection from viruses and worms; 
  
  
  Prerequisites: 
  This class is intended for upper level undergraduate students. All students
  must have some basic knowledge of number theory. Understanding of probability
  concepts is strongly recommended. Highly qualified students may be admitted
  with permission of instructor. 
  
  Prerequisite Courses: ICS 161 and one of (143, 148, 153) 
  
  
  Abstract 
  This course introduces basic concepts in cryptography and computer security
  and discusses both their theoretical foundations and practical applications.
  Various threats, attacks and countermeasures including cryptosystems,
  cryptographic protocols and secure systems/networks will be addressed. 
  The course will cover: brief history of cryptography, encryption
  (conventional and public key), digital signatures, hash functions, message
  authentication codes, randomness, unconditional and computational security,
  zero-knowledge protocols, secure e-commerce, group communication security,
  anonymity, key escrow. A few popular security mechanisms (e.g., Secure IP,
  SSL, PGP) will also be discussed.
