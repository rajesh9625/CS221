    Shape-based Pedestrian Parsing
    Yihang Bo, Charless Fowlkes
    
      
      We describe a simple model for parsing pedestrians based on shape.  Our model
assembles candidate parts from an oversegmentation of the image and matches
them to a library of exemplars. Our matching uses a hierarchical decomposition
into a variable number of parts and computes scores on partial matchings in
order to prune the search space of candidate segment. Simple constraints
enforce consistent layout of parts.  Because our model is shape-based, it
generalizes well.  We use exemplars from a controlled dataset of poses but
achieve good test performance on unconstrained images of pedestrians in street
scenes.  We demonstrate results of parsing detections returned from a standard
scanning-window pedestrian detector and use the resulting parse to perform
viewpoint prediction and detection re-scoring.
