    Viewpoint-Invariant Learning and Detection of Human Heads
    Markus Weber, Wolfgang Einhaeuser, Max Welling, Pietro Perona
    
      
      We present a method to learn models of human heads for 
the purpose of detection from different viewing angles. We 
focus on a model where objects are represented as constel- 
lations of rigid features (parts). Variability is represented 
by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of 
the constellation. In a first stage, the method automatically 
identifies distinctive features in the training set using an in- 
terest operator followed by vector quantization. The set of 
model parameters, including the shape pdf, is then learned 
using expectation maximization. Experiments show good 
generalization performance to novel viewpoints and unseen 
faces. Performance is above 90% correct with less than 1s 
computation time per image.
