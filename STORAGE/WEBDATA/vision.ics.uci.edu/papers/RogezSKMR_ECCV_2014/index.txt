      We focus on the task of everyday hand pose estimation
from egocentric viewpoints. For this task, we show
that depth sensors are particularly informative for extracting
near-ﬁeld interactions of the camera wearer with his/her environment.
Despite the recent advances in full-body pose estimation
using Kinect-like sensors, reliable monocular hand
pose estimation in RGB-D images is still an unsolved problem.
The problem is considerably exacerbated when analyzing
hands performing daily activities from a ﬁrst-person
viewpoint, due to severe occlusions arising from object manipulations
and a limited ﬁeld-of-view. Our system addresses
these difﬁculties by exploiting strong priors over viewpoint
and pose in a discriminative tracking-by-detection framework.
Our priors are operationalized through a photorealistic
synthetic model of egocentric scenes, which is used to
generate training data for learning depth-based pose classiﬁers.
We evaluate our approach on an annotated dataset
of real egocentric object manipulation scenes and compare
to both commercial and academic approaches. Our method
provides state-of-the-art performance for both hand detection
and pose estimation in egocentric RGB-D images.
