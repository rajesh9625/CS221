    Learning Multi-target Tracking with Quadratic Object Interactions
    Shaofei Wang, Charless Fowlkes
    
      
      We describe a model for multi-target tracking based
on associating collections of candidate detections across
frames of a video. In order to model pairwise interactions
between different tracks, such as suppression of overlapping
tracks and contextual cues about co-occurence of different
objects, we augment a standard min-cost flow objective with
quadratic terms between detection variables. We learn the
parameters of this model using structured prediction and a
loss function which approximates the multi-target tracking
accuracy. We evaluate two different approaches to finding
an optimal set of tracks under model objective based on an
LP relaxation and a novel greedy extension to dynamic pro-
gramming that handles pairwise interactions. We find the
greedy algorithm achieves equivalent performance to the
LP relaxation while being 2-7x faster than a commercial
solver. The resulting model with learned parameters out-
performs existing methods across several categories on the
KITTI tracking benchmark.
