    Planar Ultrametrics for Image Segmentation
    Julian Yarkony, Charless Fowlkes
    
      
      We study the problem of hierarchical clustering on planar graphs. We formulate
this in terms of finding the closest ultrametric to a specified set of distances and
solve it using an LP relaxation that leverages minimum cost perfect matching as
a subroutine to efficiently explore the space of planar partitions. We apply our
algorithm to the problem of hierarchical image segmentation.
