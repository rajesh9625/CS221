    Lifting {GIS} Maps into Strong Geometric Context
    Raul Diaz, Minhaeng Lee, Jochen Schubert, Charless Fowlkes
    
      
      Contextual information can have a substantial impact on
the performance of visual tasks such as semantic segmentation,
object detection, and geometric estimation. Data
stored in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) offers a
rich source of contextual information that has been largely
untapped by computer vision. We propose to leverage such
information for scene understanding by combining GIS resources
with large sets of unorganized photographs using
Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques. We present
a pipeline to quickly generate strong 3D geometric priors
from 2D GIS data using SfM models aligned with minimal
user input. Given an image resectioned against this
model, we generate robust predictions of depth, surface
normals, and semantic labels. We show that the precision
of the predicted geometry is substantially more accurate
other single-image depth estimation methods. We then
demonstrate the utility of these contextual constraints for rescoring
pedestrian detections, and use these GIS contextual
features alongside object detection score maps to improve
a CRF-based semantic segmentation framework, boosting
accuracy over baseline models.
