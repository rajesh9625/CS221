    Figure/Ground Assignment in Natural Images

      Figure/ground assignment is a key step in perceptual organization which assigns
contours to one of the two abutting regions, providing information about
occlusion and allowing high-level processing to focus on non-accidental shapes
of figural regions. In this paper, we develop a computational model for
figure/ground assignment in complex natural scenes. We utilize a large dataset
of images annotated with human-marked segmentations and figure/ground labels
for training and quantitative evaluation.

We operationalize the concept of familiar configuration by constructing
prototypical local shapes, i.e. shapemes, from image data. Shapemes
automatically encode mid-level visual cues to figure/ground assignment such as
convexity and parallelism. Based on the shapeme representation, we train a
logistic classifier to locally predict figure/ground labels. We also consider a
global model using a conditional random field (CRF) to enforce global
figure/ground consistency at T-junctions. We use loopy belief propagation to
perform approximate inference on this model and learn maximum likelihood
parameters from ground-truth labels.

We find that the local shapeme model achieves an accuracy of 64% in predicting
the correct figural assignment. This compares favorably to previous studies
using classical figure/ground cues. We evaluate the global model using
either a set of contours extracted from a low-level edge detector or the set of
contours given by human segmentations. The global CRF model significantly
improves the performance over the local model, most notably when using
human-marked boundaries (78%).  These promising experimental results show that
this is a feasible approach to bottom-up figure/ground assignment in natural
images.
