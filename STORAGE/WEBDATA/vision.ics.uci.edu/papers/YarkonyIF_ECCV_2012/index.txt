    Fast Planar Correlation Clustering for Image Segmentation
    Julian Yarkony, Alexander Ihler, Charless Fowlkes
    
      
      We describe a new optimization scheme for finding high-quality
clusterings in planar graphs that uses weighted perfect matching
as a subroutine. Our method provides lower-bounds on the energy of
the optimal correlation clustering that are typically fast to compute and
tight in practice. We demonstrate our algorithm on the problem of image
segmentation where this approach outperforms existing global optimization
techniques in minimizing the objective and is competitive with the
state of the art in producing high-quality segmentations.
