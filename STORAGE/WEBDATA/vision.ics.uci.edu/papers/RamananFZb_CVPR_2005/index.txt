    Tracking People and Recognizing Their Activities
    Deva Ramanan, D.A. Forsyth, Andrew Zisserman
    
      
      In this vide, we show results on people tracking and activity recognition. This video includes the contribution of 3 papers over 2 years. We show results on many sequences, including clips from a feature-length film and historical sports footage (all tracked completely automatically). We show results that utilize the tracker to obtain 3D reconstructions and activity descriptions (also done automatically).
