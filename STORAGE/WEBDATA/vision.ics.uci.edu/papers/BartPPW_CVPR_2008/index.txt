    Unsupervised Learning of Visual Taxonomies

          As more images and categories become available, organizing them becomes
    crucial. We present a novel statistical method for organizing a collection
    of images into a tree-shaped hierarchy. The method employs a non-parametric
    Bayesian model and is completely unsupervised. Each image is associated
    with a path through a tree. Similar images share initial segments of their
    paths and therefore have a smaller distance from each other. Each internal
    node in the hierarchy represents information that is common to images whose
    paths pass through that node, thus providing a compact image
    representation. Our experiments show that a disorganized collection of
    images will be organized into an intuitive taxonomy. Furthermore, we find
    that the taxonomy allows good image categorization and, in this respect, is
    superior to the popular LDA model.
