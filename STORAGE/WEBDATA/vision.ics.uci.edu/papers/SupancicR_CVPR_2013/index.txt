    Self-paced learning for long-term tracking
    James Supančič, Deva Ramanan
    
      
      We address the problem of long-term object tracking,
where the object may become occluded or leave-the-view.
In this setting, we show that an accurate appearance model
is considerably more effective than a strong motion model.
We develop simple but effective algorithms that alternate
between tracking and learning a good appearance model
given a track. We show that it is crucial to learn from the
“right” frames, and use the formalism of self-paced curriculum
learning to automatically select such frames. We
leverage techniques from object detection for learning accurate
appearance-based templates, demonstrating the importance
of using a large negative training set (typically
not used for tracking). We describe both an offline algorithm
(that processes frames in batch) and a linear-time online
(i.e. causal) algorithm that approaches real-time performance.
Our models significantly outperform prior art,
reducing the average error on benchmark videos by a factor
of 4.
