      Nano- and microscale topographical cues play critical roles in the induction and maintenance of various cellular
functions, including morphology, adhesion, gene regulation, and communication. Recent studies indicate that
structure and function at the heart tissue level is exquisitely sensitive to mechanical cues at the nano-scale as well
as at the microscale level. Although fabrication methods exist for generating topographical features for cell
culture, current techniques, especially those with nanoscale resolution, are typically complex, prohibitively
expensive, and not accessible to most biology laboratories. Here, we present a tunable culture platform comprised
of biomimetic wrinkles that simulate the heart's complex anisotropic and multiscale architecture for facile
and robust cardiac cell alignment. We demonstrate the cellular and subcellular alignment of both neonatal
mouse cardiomyocytes as well as those derived from human embryonic stem cells. By mimicking the fibrillar
network of the extracellular matrix, this system enables monitoring of protein localization in real time and
therefore the high-resolution study of phenotypic and physiologic responses to in-vivo like topographical cues.
