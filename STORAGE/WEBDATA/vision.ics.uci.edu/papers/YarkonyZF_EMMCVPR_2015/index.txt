    Hierarchical Planar Correlation Clustering for Cell Segmentation
    Julian Yarkony, Chong Zhang, Charless Fowlkes
    
      
      We introduce a novel algorithm for hierarchical clustering on
planar graphs we call “Hierarchical Greedy Planar Correlation Cluster-
ing” (HGPCC). We formulate hierarchical image segmentation as an ul-
trametric rounding problem on a superpixel graph where there are edges
between superpixels that are adjacent in the image. We apply coordi-
nate descent optimization where updates are based on planar correlation
clustering. Planar correlation clustering is NP hard but the eﬃcient Pla-
narCC solver allows for eﬃcient and accurate approximate inference. We
demonstrate HGPCC on problems in segmenting images of cells.
