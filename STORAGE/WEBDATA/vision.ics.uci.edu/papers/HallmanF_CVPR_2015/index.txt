    Oriented Edge Forests for Boundary Detection
    Sam Hallman, Charless Fowlkes
    
      
      We present a simple, efﬁcient model for learning bound-
ary detection based on a random forest classiﬁer. Our ap-
proach combines (1) efﬁcient clustering of training exam-
ples based on a simple partitioning of the space of local
edge orientations and (2) scale-dependent calibration of in-
dividual tree output probabilities prior to multiscale combi-
nation. The resulting model outperforms published results
on the challenging BSDS500 boundary detection bench-
mark. Further, on large datasets our model requires sub-
stantially less memory for training and speeds up training
time by a factor of 10 over the structured forest model.
