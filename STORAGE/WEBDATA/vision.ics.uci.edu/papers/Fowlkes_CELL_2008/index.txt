      To fully understand animal transcription networks, it is essential to
accurately measure the spatial and temporal expression patterns of
transcription factors and their targets. We describe a registration technique
that takes image-based data from hundreds of Drosophila blastoderm embryos,
each costained for a reference gene and one of a set of genes of interest, and
builds a model VirtualEmbryo. This model captures in a common framework the
average expression patterns for many genes in spite of significant variation in
morphology and expression between individual embryos. We establish the method's
accuracy by showing that relationships between a pair of genes' expression
inferred from the model are nearly identical to those measured in embryos
costained for the pair. We present a VirtualEmbryo containing data for 95 genes
at six time cohorts. We show that known gene-regulatory interactions can be
automatically recovered from this data set and predict hundreds of new
interactions.
