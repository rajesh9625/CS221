    Layered Object Models for Image Segmentation
    Yi Yang, Sam Hallman, Deva Ramanan, Charless Fowlkes
    
      
      We formulate a layered model for object detection and image segmentation. We
describe a generative probabilistic model that composites the output of a bank
of object detectors in order to define shape masks and explain the appearance,
depth ordering, and labels of all pixels in an image. Notably, our system
estimates both class labels and object instance labels. Building on previous
benchmark criteria for object detection and image segmentation, we define a
novel score that evaluates both class and instance segmentation. We evaluate
our system on the PASCAL 2009 and 2010 segmentation challenge datasets and show
good test results with state of the art performance in several categories
including segmenting humans.
