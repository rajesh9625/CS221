    Topographic Product Models Applied to Natural Scene Statistics
    Simon Osindero, Max Welling, Geoffrey Hinton
    
      
      We present an energy-based model that uses a product of generalised 
Student-t distributions to capture the statistical structure in datasets. This 
model is inspired by and particularly applicable to natural datasets such 
as images. We begin by providing the mathematical framework, where 
we discuss complete and overcomplete models, and provide algorithms 
for training these models from data. Using patches of natural scenes we 
demonstrate that our approach represents a viable alternative to independent components analysis as an interpretive model of biological visual 
systems. Although the two approaches are similar in flavor there are also 
important differences, particularly when the representations are overcomplete. By constraining the interactions within our model we are also able 
to study the topographic organization of Gabor-like receptive fields that 
are learned by our model. Finally, we discuss the relation of our new approach to previous work  in particular Gaussian Scale Mixture models, 
and variants of independent components analysis.
