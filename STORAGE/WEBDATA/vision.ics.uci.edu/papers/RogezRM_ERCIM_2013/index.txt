    Egovision4Health - Assessing Activities of Daily Living from a Wearable RGB-D Camera for In-Home Health Care Applications
    Grégory Rogez, Deva Ramanan, J.M.M. Montiel
    
      
      Camera miniaturization and mobile computing now make it feasible to capture and process videos
from body-worn cameras such as the Google Glass headset. This egocentric perspective is particularly
well-suited to recognizing objects being handled or observed by the wearer, as well as analysing the
gestures and tracking the activities of the wearer. Egovision4Health is a joint research project
between the University of Zaragoza, Spain and the University of California, Irvine, USA The objective of
this three-year project, currently in its first year, is to investigate new egocentric computer vision
techniques to automatically provide health professionals with an assessment of their patients' ability
to manipulate objects and perform daily activities.
