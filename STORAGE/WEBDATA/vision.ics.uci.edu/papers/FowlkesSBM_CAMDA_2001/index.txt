    Extracting Global Structure from Gene Expression Profiles
    Charless Fowlkes, Qun Shan, Serge Belongie, Jitendra Malik
    
      
      We have developed a program, GENECUT, for analysing datasets from gene
expression profiling. GENECUT is based on a pairwise clustering method
known as Normalized Cut [Shi and Malik, 1997]. GENECUT extracts global
structures by progressively partitioning datasets into well-balanced groups,
performing an intuitive k-way partitioning at each stage in contrast to
commonly used 2-way partitioning schemes. By making use of the Nyström
approximation, it is possible to perform clustering on very large genomic
datasets.
