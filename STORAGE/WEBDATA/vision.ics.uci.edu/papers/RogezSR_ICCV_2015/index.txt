    Understanding Everyday Hands in Action from RGB-D Images
    Grégory Rogez, James Supančič, Deva Ramanan
    
      
      We analyze functional manipulations of handheld objects,
formalizing the problem as one of fine-grained grasp
classification. To do so, we make use of a recently developed
fine-grained taxonomy of human-object grasps. We introduce
a large dataset of 12000 RGB-D images covering 71
everyday grasps in natural interactions. Our dataset is different
from past work (typically addressed from a robotics
perspective) in terms of its scale, diversity, and combination
of RGB and depth data. From a computer-vision perspective,
our dataset allows for exploration of contact and force
prediction (crucial concepts in functional grasp analysis)
from perceptual cues. We present extensive experimental
results with state-of-the-art baselines, illustrating the role
of segmentation, object context, and 3D-understanding in
functional grasp analysis. We demonstrate a near 2X improvement
over prior work and a naive deep baseline, while
pointing out important directions for improvement.
