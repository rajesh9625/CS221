      The Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project is developing a suite
of methods to convert volumetric data generated by confocal fluorescence
microscopy into numerical, three dimensional representations of gene
expression at cellular resolution. One key difficulty is that fluorescence
microscopy can only capture expression levels for a few gene products in a
given animal. We report on a method for registering 3D expression data from
different Drosophila embryos stained for overlapping subsets of gene
products in order to build a composite atlas, ultimately containing
co-expression information for thousands of genes. Our techniques have also
allowed the discovery of a complex pattern of cell density across the blastula
that changes over time and may play a role in gastrulation.
