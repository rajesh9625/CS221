    Cue Integration for Figure/Ground Labeling
    Xiaofeng Ren, Charless Fowlkes, Jitendra Malik
    
      
      We present a model of edge and region grouping using a conditional random field
built over a scale-invariant representation of images to inte- grate multiple
cues. Our model includes potentials that capture low-level similarity,
mid-level curvilinear continuity and high-level object shape.  Maximum
likelihood parameters for the model are learned from human labeled groundtruth
on a large collection of horse images using belief propagation. Using held out
test data, we quantify the information gained by incorporating generic
mid-level cues and high-level shape.
