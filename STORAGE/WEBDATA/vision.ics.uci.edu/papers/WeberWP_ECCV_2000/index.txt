    Unsupervised Learning of Models for Recognition
    Markus Weber, Max Welling, Pietro Perona
    
      
      We present a method to learn object class models from unlabeled and 
unsegmented cluttered scenes for the purpose of visual object recognition. We 
focus on a particular type of model where objects are represented as flexible constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented 
by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and 
the output of part detectors. In a first stage, the method automatically identifies 
distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns 
selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using 
expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classification results 
on human faces and rear views of cars.
