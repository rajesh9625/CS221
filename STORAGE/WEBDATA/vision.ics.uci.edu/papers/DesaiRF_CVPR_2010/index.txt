    Discriminative models for static human-object interactions
    Chaitanya Desai, Deva Ramanan, Charless Fowlkes
    
      
      We advocate an approach to activity recognition based on modeling contextual
interactions between postured human bodies and nearby objects. We focus on the
difficult task of recognizing actions from static images and formulate the
problem as a latent structured labeling problem. We develop a unified,
discriminative model for such context-based action recognition building on
recent techniques for learning large-scale discriminative models. The resulting
contextual models learned by our system outperform previously published results
on a database of sports actions.
