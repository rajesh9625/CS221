    Inferring nuclear movements from fixed material
    Charless Fowlkes, Jitendra Malik
    
      
      We describe a technique for inferring the typical movement of nuclei in
Drosophila blastoderm using nuclear positions extracted from a large number of
images of fixed embryos. Embryos are sorted into temporal cohorts and each
cohort is represented by the average blastoderm shape and average density of
nuclei along the blastoderm surface. To find cell movements, we formulate a
cost function that measures how well a given placement of a set of "synthetic
nuclei" respects the measured average density for the cohort. This function is
optimized for each cohort in turn, initialized with the results of the previous
time step. The result is a synthetic time series of changing nuclear locations
which recapitulates average nuclear density and blastoderm shape seen under the
microscope.
