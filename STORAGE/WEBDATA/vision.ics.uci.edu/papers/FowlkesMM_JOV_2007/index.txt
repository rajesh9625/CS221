    Local figure-ground cues are valid for natural images
    Charless Fowlkes, David Martin, Jitendra Malik
    
      
      Figure­ground organization refers to the visual perception that a contour
separating two regions belongs to one of the regions. Recent studies have found
neural correlates of figure­ground assignment in V2 as early as 10­25 ms after
response onset, providing strong support for the role of local bottom­up
processing. How much information about figure­ ground assignment is available
from locally computed cues? Using a large collection of natural images, in
which neighboring regions were assigned a figure­ground relation by human
observers, we quantified the extent to which figural regions locally tend to be
smaller, more convex, and lie below ground regions. Our results suggest that
these Gestalt cues are ecologically valid, and we quantify their relative
power. We have also developed a simple bottom­up computational model of
figure­ground assignment that takes image contours as input. Using parameters
fit to natural image statistics, the model is capable of matching human-level
performance when scene context limited.
