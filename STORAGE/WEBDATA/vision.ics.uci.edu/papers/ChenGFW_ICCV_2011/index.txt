    Integrating Local Classifiers through Nonlinear Dynamics on Label Graphs with an Application to Image Segmentation
    Yutian Chen, Andrew Gelfand, Charless Fowlkes, Max Welling
    
      
      We present a new method to combine possibly inconsistent locally (piecewise) trained conditional models p(y|x) into pseudo-samples from a global model. Our method does not require training of a CRF, but instead generates samples by iterating forward a weakly chaotic dynamical system. The new method is illustrated on image segmentation tasks where classifiers based on local appearance cues are combined with pairwise boundary cues.
