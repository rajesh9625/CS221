    Patch Mosaic for Fast Motion Deblurring
    Hyeoungho Bae, Charless Fowlkes, Pai Chou
    
      
      This paper proposes using a mosaic image patches composed
of the most informative edges found in the original blurry image for the
purpose of estimating a motion blur kernel with minimum computational
cost. To select these patches we develop a new image analysis tool to
efficiently locate informative patches we call the informative-edge map.
The combination of patch mosaic and informative patch selection enables
a new motion blur kernel estimation algorithm to recover blur kernels
far more quickly and accurately than existing state-of-the-art methods.
We also show that patch mosaic can form a framework for reducing the
computation time of other motion deblurring algorithms with minimal
modification. Experimental results with various test images show that
our algorithm to be 5-100 times faster than previously published blind
motion deblurring algorithms while achieving equal or better estimation
accuracy.
