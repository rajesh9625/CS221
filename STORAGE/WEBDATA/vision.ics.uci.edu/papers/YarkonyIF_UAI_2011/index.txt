    Planar Cycle Covering Graphs
    Julian Yarkony, Alex Ihler, Charless Fowlkes
    
      
      We describe a new variational lower-bound on the minimum energy configuration
of a planar binary Markov Random Field (MRF).  Our method is based on adding
auxiliary nodes to every face of a planar embedding of the graph in order to
capture the effect of unary potentials.  A ground state of the resulting
approximation can be computed efficiently by reduction to minimum-weight
perfect matching. We show that optimization of variational parameters achieves
the same lower-bound as dual-decomposition into the set of all cycles of the
original graph.  We demonstrate that our variational optimization converges
quickly and provides high-quality solutions to hard combinatorial problems
10-100x faster than competing algorithms that optimize the same bound.
