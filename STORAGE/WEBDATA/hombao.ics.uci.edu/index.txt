WHAT WE DO


We develop novel statistical methods and models for analyzing massive spatio-temporal data with complex dependence structures. We collaborate with scientists on study design, modeling and analysis of space-time data arising from various fields such as neuroscience, neurology, psychiatry, sociology and epidemiology.  Through collaborative projects, we engage undergraduate and graduate students in all phases of inter-disciplinary research including model formulation, implementation and presentation of results.
