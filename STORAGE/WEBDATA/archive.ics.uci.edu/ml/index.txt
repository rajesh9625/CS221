Welcome to the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository!






We currently maintain 336 data sets as a service to the machine learning community.
You may view all data sets through our 
searchable interface.  Our old web 
site 
is still available, for those who prefer the old format.  For a general overview of the Repository, please visit our About page.
For information about citing data sets in publications, please read our citation policy.  If you wish to donate a data set, please consult our donation policy.
For any other questions, feel free to contact the Repository librarians.

We have also set up a mirror site for the Repository.
