Utilizing New Technologies in Managing Hazards and Disasters  Nanda Kambhatla has nearly 17 years of
research experience in the 

  areas
of Natural Language Processing (NLP), text mining, information 

  extraction, dialog systems, and machine
learning. He holds 6 U.S 

  patents
and has authored over 30 publications in books, journals, and 

  conferences in these areas. Nanda holds a
B.Tech in Computer Science 

  and
Engineering from the Institute of Technology, Benaras Hindu 

  University, India, and a Ph.D in Computer
Science and Engineering from 

  the
Oregon Graduate Institute of Science & Technology, Oregon, USA.

 

  Currently, Nanda is the manager of the Data
Analytics Group at IBM's 

  India
Research Lab (IRL), Bangalore. The group is focused on research 

  on
machine translation, Natural Language Processing, text analysis and 

  machine
learning techniques for developing analytics solutions to help 

  IBM's
services divisions. Most recently, Nanda was the manager of the 

  Statistical Text Analytics Group at IBM's T.J.
Watson Research Center, 

  the
Watson co-chair of the Natural Language Processing PIC, and the 

  task PI
for the Language  Exploitation
Environment (LEE) subtask for 

  the
DARPA GALE project. He has been leading the development of 

  information extraction tools/products and his
team has achieved top 

  tier
results in successive Automatic Content Extraction

  (ACE)
evaluations conducted

  by NIST
for extracting entities, events and relations from text from 

  multiple sources, in multiple languages and
genres.

 

  Earlier
in his career, Nanda has worked on natural language web-based 

  and
spoken dialog systems at IBM. Before joining IBM, he has worked on 

  information retrieval and filtering algorithms
as a senior research 

  scientist
at WiseWire Corporation, Pittsburgh and on image compression 

  algorithms while working as a postdoctoral
fellow under Prof. Simon 

  Haykin
at McMaster University, Canada.

 

  Nanda's
research interests are focused on NLP and technology solutions 

  for
creating, storing, searching, and processing large volumes of 

  unstructured data (text, audio, video,

  etc.)
and specifically on applications of statistical learning 

  algorithms to these tasks.
