			Studies: 
			 The team conducted three studies during this reporting period:
 A technology assessment at a live burn exercise was held Feb. 23rd with the Anaheim F.D., Orange County Fire Authority, and LA County F.D.  Goals of this study included calibration of our wearable carbon monoxide sensors, assessment of commercial carboxyhemoglobin sensors in a field setting (e.g., structural fire), and off UCI campus deployment of the SAFIRE FICB and supporting systems. Ample data was obtained for the calibration goal.  Firefighter movement caused some false readings to be made by the commercial carboxyhemoglobin monitors but we believe these can be successfully filtered out or eliminated through improved sensor design.
 A situational awareness assessment using the SAGAT methodology was conducted during an exercise held at UCI on May 12th.  In the simulated hazmat incident, one IC had access to the SAFIRE system while the other relied on more traditional technologies (radio).  The results of this experiment are being analyzed for inclusion in an article or technical report.
 A SAFIRE usability study was conducted at the May 17th SAFIRE firefighter forum as part of a tabletop exercise, in order to evaluate improvements in decision making due to enhanced situational awareness provided by the SAFIRE system.  Results indicate a high degree of both usability as well as decision making impact (by virtue of increased information and enhanced situational awareness) in those respondents with Incident Command experience.  Qualitative feedback was also captured in the study.
