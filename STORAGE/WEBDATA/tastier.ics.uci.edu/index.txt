The TASTIER Project on Efficient Auto-Completion, Type-Ahead SearchTASTIER: Efficient Auto-Completion, Type-Ahead Search
Mirror Site at Tsinghua University




Objective

TASTIER is a joint research project between
Tsinghua University and 
UC Irvine.  It focuses on efficient
autocompletion, type-ahead search on large data sets of various types,
such as relational data, documents, semi-structured data.  "TASTIER" stands for
type-ahead
search techniques in large data sets.
