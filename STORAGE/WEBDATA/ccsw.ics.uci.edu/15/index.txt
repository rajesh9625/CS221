		Overview
		
			The CCSW workshop brings together researchers and practitioners in all security
			and privacy aspects of cloud-centric and outsourced computing, including:
		
		
				practical cryptographic protocols for cloud security
			
			outsourced privacy-preserving computation
		
		secure cloud resource virtualization mechanisms
	
	secure data management outsourcing (e.g., database as a service)

practical privacy and integrity mechanisms for outsourcing

privacy-enhancing technologies for the cloud

foundations of cloud-centric threat models

secure computation outsourcing

remote attestation mechanisms in clouds

sandboxing and VM-based enforcements

trust and policy management in clouds

secure identity management mechanisms

new cloud-aware web service security paradigms and mechanisms

cloud-centric regulatory compliance issues and mechanisms

business and security risk models and clouds

cost and usability models and their interaction with security in clouds

scalability of security in global-size clouds

trusted computing technology and clouds

binary analysis of software for remote attestation and cloud protection

network security (DOS, IDS etc.) mechanisms for cloud contexts

security for emerging cloud programming models

energy/cost/efficiency of security in clouds

security for software defined networking


	We would like to especially encourage novel paradigms and controversial ideas
	that are not on the above list. The workshop is to act as a fertile ground for
	creative debate and interaction in security-sensitive areas of computing 
	impacted by clouds.



	Impact


	CCSW has had a significant impact in our research community. As of April 2015, in the Google Scholar Metrics entry for CCS (which encompasses CCSW), 4 of the top 20 cited papers of the past five years come from CCSW. One way to look at it is that you're as likely or perhaps more likely to have a top-20 paper publishing in CCSW than in CCS! (thanks to Ari Juels for noticing this)
