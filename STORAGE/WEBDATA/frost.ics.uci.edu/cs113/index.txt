Ground rules
Your grade will be based mostly
     on your team's accomplishments, which are primarily the
     design document, the delivered game, and the final presentation.
     No quizzes, tests, or final exam.
     Usually all team members get the same grade for the team game.

 If you add the course after Sept. 29, or if you do not fill out and turn
in the Team Information Form,
or if you drop from your team and do not find another team,
then
you will not be able to work on a team and the
best possible grade you can get for the course will be a B.



Important Dates
Attendance during the lecture period is required on certain days, often those with student or
guest speakers:
 Thursday, Oct. 1: team announcements and first team meetings
 Team Pitches: Tuesday, Oct. 27, Thursday, Oct. 29, Tuesday, Nov. 3

Assignments and projects
 First individual assignment, due Tuesday, 9/29/2015 7:00pm:
     completed Team Information Form.

 Second individual assignment, due Sunday, 10/25/2015:
     Comment on another team's draft design.

 Third individual assignment: six weekly status reports,
	 due Mondays of sixth through Finals weeks.




 The major part of the course is a project, to be completed by a team.
The project will be to design and implement substantial portions of
a computer game.
The project consists of the following:
 A statement of team composition.  Name the students on the team,
     the grade option of each student, the major of each student,
     the team name, brief descriptions of two ideas you are considering
     for the team's game, and the time and place your team will meet
     for three hours every week.
     If you plan to work with students from  outside
     of the class, please mention that as well.
     Send by email to m.rahimzadeh at uci.edu,
     Friday, 10/2/2015, by noon.
     Put "CS 113/Inf 125" at the start of the email's subject line.
 A draft design document for the game.  This should be between
     20 and 40 pages in length.  It should be on the World Wide Web
     using HTML, PDF, or Google Docs.
     The format must permit scrolling through the entire document;
     therefore a wiki is not acceptable.
     Due Wednesday, 10/21/2015 (by the end of the day).
     Email the URL of your draft to Prof. Frost.
     Structure your Design Doc based on
     our recommended Design Doc structure.
 A presentation, or "pitch," of the team's game idea
     in the fifth or sixth week of the class Tuesday, 10/27/2015,
     or Thursday, 10/29/2015, or Tuesday, 11/3/2015 (subject to change).
 A final design document for the game.  This should be about
     30 to 40 pages in length.  In addition to describing the game,
     technologies, art, and game play in detail,
     it should describe the specific responsibilities
     of each team member.
     Due Wednesday, 11/4/2015 (for teams pitching in week 5) or
     due Friday, 11/6/2015 (for teams pitching in week 6).
     This is also on the web,
     and the URL should be emailed to Prof. Frost.
 A presentation of the game development status in eighth week. (Cancelled)
 A presentation of the game at the end of week 10 or in Finals Week.
	 To be scheduled; each team will have 30 minutes.
     Your team's grade will be based
     on the game as of this presentation.
 A two to three minute video of the game and the team, ideally posted on YouTube.
 A completion document, which includes an optional users manual,
     revised design document,
     individual statements about the course of the project (optional), and a
     CD with source code, executables, art and
     music files, a link to the game video, and at least two screen shots.
     Due at final presentation.
 Participation in the CS 113/Informatics 125 Open House, held during
     the course's Final Exam period, Tuesday, 12/8/2015 7:00pm-9:00pm.






Scoring and grading

Grading will be on a straight scale, based on total points.
(A+ 97.0 or higher;
A  93.0 to 96.9;
A- 90.0 to 92.9;
B+ 87.0 to 89.9;
B  83.0 to 86.9;
B- 80.0 to 82.9; and so on.)



Each game project will receive a letter grade, e.g.
A, A-, B+, B (these are by far the most common grades).
The game project is worth at most 75 points, as follows:
A+, 73 to 75; A, 71; A-, 68; B+, 65; B, 62; and so on.


The game design document (including pitch and 8th
week status reports) is worth up to 10 points; most teams
will get 9 (an A).
Students who miss part or all of their team's pitch
will receive less credit.


Individual accomplishments are worth up to 15 points:


5 - attendance (roll will be taken on six or more dates)

2 - comment on another team's draft design document

2 - attendance at and energy demonstrated in eighth week presentation

6 - six status reports







Special Accommodations:
Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on
the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss
his or her specific needs.
Also contact the Disability Services
Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to ensure that
such accommodations are implementationed in a timely fashion.







At the Computer Game Design Conference on May 6, 1998, there
was a panel on design docs.  Moderator Alex Dunne referenced a real
design document which was submitted by panelist John Jack, a producer
at Monolith.  This design doc was from the company's recent computer
game, "Claw".

Claw Design Document.
