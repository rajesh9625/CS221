          Abstract 
          In recent years, many websites have started providing keyword-search 
          services on maps. In these systems, users may experience difficulties 
          finding the entities they are looking for if they do not know their 
          exact spelling, such as the name of a restaurant. In this paper, we 
          present a solution to support fuzzy keyword search on spatial data. 
          We combine a spatial index structure with inverted indexes on grams 
          to efficiently answer fuzzy queries on maps. We show two system 
          prototypes to demonstrate the practicality of our solution.

          Demos 
          We used two real datasets to develop two prototypes for demonstration: 
          Demo 
            on the CoPhIR dataset which 
            is a multimedia metadata collection extracted from Flickr pages.
            Demo 
            using the GeoNames geographical 
            database which contains geographical objects such as lakes and hills.
