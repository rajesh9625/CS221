Carey and Li) Active, Scalable, Transactional Enterprise Repository for Information in XML. A new effort to develop a scalable semistructured information management system, based on XML and XQuery technologies, targeting very large shared-nothing compute clusters.CONTESSA(Prof. Venkatasubramanian with colleagues at UIUC, WUSTL and SRI.) This project adresses various aspects of context sensitive system adaptation to support interoperability with a specific focus on the use of formal methods to develop and reason about adaptive systems.CYPRESS(Prof. Venkatasubramanian and Mehrotra with colleagues at SRI.) The CYPRESS is a CYber Physical RESilliance and Sustainability project derived its name from the Cypress tree which represents vitality, durability and sustainability.DYNAMO(Prof. Venkatasubramanian with UCI colleagues) A middleware framework (Linux based) for cross-layer adaptation of power-saving mechanisms at different system layers for improved QoS and battery lifetime on low-power mobile devices.Dissemination: Customized Content Dissemination in the Large(Profs. Mehrotra and Venkatasubramanian) A project studying principles and techniques for timely, accurate information dissemination to the public to encourage self-protective actions (such as evacuation or sheltering-in-place) to reduce exposure to those at risk and provide reassurance to those not at risk under natural and human-induced threats.E2E(Prof. Jain) Environment to Environment Connectivity. A project to develop concepts and technology to make sensory interactions a primary modus operandi in cyber-physical spaces.EMME(Prof. Jain) Experiential Media Management Environment. A research project on the organization of personal multimedia data for individuals for search, sharing, and storytelling.FLAMINGO(Prof. Li) A research project to create an open-source library for data cleaning and fuzzy query processing, aimed at making query answering and information retrieval efficient in the presence of inconsistencies and errors.MAPGrid(Prof. Venkatasubramanian) A project on devising efficient resource discovery algorithms and data placement strategies for providing mobile users with multimedia services by leveraging heterogeneous and intermittently available grid resources.Privacy Middleware for the Internet(Prof. Mehrotra) An effort to design privacy middleware to sit between applications and Web storage services to allow users to benefit from the services without having to compromise on their privacy.RESCUE (Responding to Crises and Unexpected Events)(Profs. Mehrotra, Venkatasubramanian, and Kalashnikov) An NSF ITR project that is exploring how scalable and robust information technology solutions can empower first responders and response organizations to mitigate a crisis and dynamically improve crisis response.Responsphere (An IT Infrastructure for Responding to the Unexpected)(Prof. Mehrotra) Responsphere is an IT infrastructure test-bed that incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to emergency response drawing from academia, government, and private enterprise. The IT infrastructure can facilitate rapid and seamless access to and dissemination of information.SAFIRE(Profs. Mehrotra and Venkatasubramanian) A DHS-funded project exploring how situational awareness created through usage of multiple sensor technologies (e.g., radio communication, video, environmental sensors, physiological sensors) can improve the safety of fire fighters in both large structural and wild fires.SATWARE(Profs. Mehrotra and Venkatasubramian) A project that aims at realizing sentient spaces by exploring a multimodal sensor data stream through the use of query, analysis, and transformation middleware.SHERLOCK(Profs. Mehrotra and Kalashnikov) A project on graph-based exploitation of semantics to improve data quality, including semantics implicit in the data and/or explicit constraints/rules, to address ambiguity in entity resolution, record linkage, Web people search, speech-based tagging, and multimedia event detection.TASTIER(Prof. Li) TASTIER is a joint research project between Tsinghua University and UC Irvine. It focuses on efficient autocompletion, type-ahead search on large data sets of various types, such as relational data, documents, semi-structured data.xTUNE(Prof. Venkatasubramanian with UCI/SRI colleagues) This research effort to integrate formal analytical methods for understanding cross-layer end-to-end timing/reliability issues into the design and adaptation processes for mobile distributed systems, leading to a Linux-based middleware framework for cross-layer adaptation of power-saving mechanisms for improved QoS and battery lifetime on low-power devices.^ topSelected Past ProjectsCompose|Q(Prof. Venkatasubramanian) A reflective architecture for safe composability of middleware services to achieve performance/QoS tradeoffs based on core services that can be reused under constraints to ensure safety composition of "ilities" (security, reliability, and quality of service).Database as a Service(Prof. Mehrotra) One of the first projects to explore the data privacy and search challenges in hosting a large-scale data management service over the internet.FORGE(Prof. Venkatasubramanian with other UCI/UCSD colleagues) Techniques for cross-Layer adaptation that meets QoS/energy tradeoffs for mobile multimedia applications, including: content transcoding, network traffic shaping, backlight optimizations, memory adaptations.Family Reunification(Prof. Li) Techniques to help people find their loved ones during or after a disaster.MARS (Multimedia Analysis and Retrieval System)(Prof. Mehrotra) An integrated multimedia information retrieval and data management system that provided support for multimedia information as first-class objects capable of being stored and retrieved based on their rich internal content.QUASAR (Quality Aware Data Management)(Prof. Mehrotra) An early project on progressive database query evaluation techniques that exploit the tradeoff between cost and result quality.RACCOON(Prof. Li) An early project on distributed data integration and sharing.^ topOther Selected Past IGS Faculty Projects (and Products!)ALDSP(Prof. Carey and BEA colleagues) The AquaLogic Data Services Platform, a commercial service-oriented information integration platform that Prof. Carey contributed to, as an architect and engineering director, while an employee of BEA. (Recently renamed as the Oracle Data Service Integrator.)IBM DB2(Prof. Carey and IBM colleagues) A commercial relational database management system that Prof. Carey contributed to, as leader of a team that added various object-relational SQL extensions, while an employee of IBM.Shore(Prof. Carey and Wisconsin colleagues) A University of Wisconsin project that Prof. Carey co-led to create a persistent object system intended to serve a wide variety of target applications, including hardware and software CAD systems, persistent programming languages, geographic information systems, satellite data repositories, and multimedia applications.TSIMMIS(Prof. Li and Stanford colleagues) A pioneering Stanford University project on semistructured data integration that Prof. Li participated in while he was a Ph.D. student there.^ topLast Updated on January 07, 2011
