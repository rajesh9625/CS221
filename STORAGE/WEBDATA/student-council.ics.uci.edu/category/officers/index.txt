        ICSSC Vice-President

        Dalton Kraatz2015-09-24T03:03:02+00:00Hello everyone!
I am Dalton Kraatz, a 3rd year Computer Science major (specializing in both Algorithms and Information), and your 2015-2016 ICS Student Council Vice-President.
I have been an active ICSSC member since about my 3rd week of freshman year. I regret not going sooner because I’ve made so many friends. I’ve been involved with Projects for a long time, but as a returning executive, I began to see value in each committee. I enjoy how strongly our groups discuss their work, and when new members join we all help them fit in. The same happened for me as a freshman. When I brought some of my classmates in, they too began to see why I love going to Student Council. (more…)

I will be a second year Computer Science and Engineering major and a business minor. My role, and those of my committee members, is to address the needs and wants of the student body and to facilitate a meaningful connection between the students and the faculty. The AAA committee will cover a wide range of responsibilities and tasks, such as event promotion, faculty relationships, and addressing the specific concerns of the student body. My goal for me and my committee is that by the end of the year, we will have provided you an enriching, inspiring, and memorable year!
