                                                            It is our great pride to report that the planar multi-projection display, which is currently the attention of a significant amount of research conducted in the iGravi lab, is part of the logo for the top international conference in virtual reality, IEEE Virtual Reality 2013. IEEE VR 2012 was hosted by the iGravi lab in March 2012. It was the most attended conference in the history of IEEE VR. As part of IEEE VR 2012, we had a very successful Open House at Calit2 showcasing all the research projects at iGravi where we also demonstrated this planar multi-projector display. Almost 450 people from around the globe attended the Open House.

                                                            We had two papers in Siggraph 2012 from UCI. This is the first time we have had papers in Siggraph from UCI. Our paper on new enhanced resolution projection based displays was one of the four papers in the sole session on Computational Displays -- a very new emerging area in computer graphics and visualilzation community. The other papers were from MIT, Stanford and UC-Berkeley. We are very proud to wrestle a spot amongst such well-know players.

                                                            The paper, entitled "Using Patterns to Encode Color Information in Dichromats," explores ways to use patterns to represent color.
                                                            This paper proposes a technique for using patterns to encode color information for individuals with CVD, in particular for dichromats.  Further, since overlaying patterns does not compromise the underlying original colors, it does not hamper the perception of normal trichromats.

                                                            Once again, IEEE VR 2012 is pleased to be co-located with IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces (March 4-5). In addition, this time we are co-locating ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics,  2012 with IEEE VR. ACM I3D will happen just following IEEE VR on March  9-11, 2012 at the same venue. We hope that the co-location of these two  conferences with large overlapping domains and interest will bring forth  new ways to support cross-fertilization of ideas.
                                                            IEEE VR, hosted by  University of California, Irvine, will be held at the Westin South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa  in Orange County, CA. Orange County belongs to the greater Los Angeles  (LA) area which is one of the biggest academic and IT centers of USA.  UC-Irvine, UC-Los Angeles, University of Southern California, and  Cal-State Fullerton are the main academic centers of the area. Los  Angeles, Irvine, Westminister and other such towns of the area are the  home of thousands of IT companies including gaming (e.g. Blizzard),  entertainment (e.g. Disney, Dreamworks, Pixar, Institute for Creative  Technologies), and devices (e.g. BenQ, Canon). With the co-location of  IEEE 3DUI and ACM I3D, we will provide ample opportunities for  cross-fertilization of ideas and technology across different synergistic  communities centered around virtual reality.

                                                            Aditi Majumder, Computer Science Associate Professor, was a keynote speaker at the  International Symposium on Visual Computing  2010, a prestigious graphics and vision conference that brings together renowned researchers from all over the world.
                                                            Majumder’s talk, “Ubiquitous Displays: A Distributed Network of Active  Displays,” presents her team’s work-in-progress on developing a new  display paradigm in which displays are not mere carriers of information,  but active members of the workspace — interacting with data, user,  environment and other displays. The goal is to integrate such active  displays seamlessly with the environment, making them ubiquitous to  multiple users and data.
                                                            Majumder’s research aims to make multi-projector displays truly  commodity products and easily accessible to the common man. Her  significant research contributions include photometric and color  registration across multi-projector displays, enabling use of imperfect  projectors in tiled displays, and more recently a distributed framework  for tiled displays via a distributed network of projector-camera pairs. A  2009 recipient of the NSF CAREER award, she has played a key role in  developing the first curved screen multi-projector display being  marketed by NEC/Alienware and is an advisor at Disney Imagineering for  advances in their projection-based theme park rides.

Her paper entitled, "Display Gamut  Reshaping for Color Emulation and Balancing" was coauthored by  researchers at Ostendo Technologies Ltd.
                                                            Majumder et al present a hardware-assisted 3D gamut reshaping method  that handles a gamut expansion in LED based DLP displays in emerging  mobile digital light projectors (known commonly as pico-projectors).  These projectors use multiple LED/laser sources instead of a singular  white lamp providing a larger color gamut. The full abstract and paper  can be found here [PDF link].

                                                            The paper, entitled "Auto-Calibration of Cylindrical  Multi-Projector Systems," explores registering multiple projectors on vertically extruded a  cylindrical display, which previously was only possible with a calibrated stereo camera.
                                                            This papers shows that using some simple priors, one  can achieve multiple projector registration on a cylindrical display using a single uncalibrated  camera without any markers on the display.  More importantly, the new method enables use of multiple  overlapped projectors across corners of a vertically extruded surface with sharp edges. This is of  tremendous benefit to virtual reality display systems like CAVEs, that avoided mounting projectors across the  corners until today.
                                                            The full paper can be accessed here:                    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~majumder/docs/VR10.pdf.

                                                            The paper presents the first algorithm to geometrically  register multiple projectors in a view-independent manner on a common type of curved surface, vertically extruded  surface, using an uncalibrated camera without attaching any obtrusive markers to the display screen. This simple  markerless registration has the potential to have a large impact on easy set-up and maintenance of large curved  multi-projector displays, common for visualization, edutainment,                 training and simulation applications.
