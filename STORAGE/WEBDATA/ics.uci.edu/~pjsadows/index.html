            PhD Student 
            Department of Computer Science 
            Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics 
            Advisor: Pierre Baldi 
            
            I study machine learning, particularly deep learning with artificial neural networks. I am interested in the development of novel algorithms and model architectures for learning useful data representations.
            
            
            Artificial neural networks can learn a broad set of functions from data. At UCI, I am working on a number of applications to the natural sciences, including the prediction of chemical reactions and the detection of exotic particles in high-energy physics.
