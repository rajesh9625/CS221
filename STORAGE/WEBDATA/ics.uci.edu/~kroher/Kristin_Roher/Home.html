                About Me
                
                
                    I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh. As an undergraduate, I leveraged iOS powered devices to calculate life-cycle assessment (LCA) scenarios using grid computing principles. Specifically, I wrote an application to receive data from a server (by allowing the server to ping the iOS device when data was available), compute a section of an LCA calculation, and send the results back to the server. I am currently conducting research with Professor Debra Richardson at the University of California, Irvine in pursuit of a Ph.D. in Informatics. My research involves introducing sustainability into the software engineering process as well as the web application described below.

                    My current research My current research is within the field of sustainable HCI (human computer interaction). My work aims to leverage existing theories and techniques on social influence to design ICT systems that increase behaviors that contribute to sustainability. Research within social influence suggests that an individual’s sustainable behaviors will increase if they are made aware of the sustainable behaviors of others, especially others who are similar to them (e.g. friends or those in the same community). Information technology can be used to create this awareness through the use of social networks. Current approaches to behavior change within sustainable HCI have often focused on the individual as a rational actor. My work provides a more holistic view of individual behavior by considering the social factors that influence behavior.

                    Over the past two summers I worked on a project with Girls Inc of Orange County to provide week-long summer camps to girls aged 13-18. The camps not only provided low-income girls with an opportunity to learn to program robots to dance, it also aimed to empower girls with a desire to learn more about STEM majors and careers. On the first day of the camp we asked how many were interested in computer science and only about 2 out of 20 girls raised their hands each week, however, by the end of the week we had more than 3/4 of the girls raising their hands when asked the same question. The camps taught the girls how fun computer science can be and about the many opportunities provided by knowing computer science skills. My role at the camp was to provide instruction, develop the curriculum, provide technical support for the robots and associated software, and assist in mentorship of the girls. By the end of the week the girls were able to code the robot to dance, tell jokes, hold conversations, and respond to commands.
