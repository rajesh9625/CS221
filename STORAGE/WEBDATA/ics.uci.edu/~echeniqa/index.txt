About Me




Hi, I'm Andy. I'm a first year PhD student at the University of California, Irvine studying Computer Supported Cooperative Work as well as cross-cultural interaction. 
I've been working for over 5 years in Human-Computer Interaction research at places such as Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Georgia Tech's GVU Center,
and NTT's Communication Science Laboratories in Japan.
