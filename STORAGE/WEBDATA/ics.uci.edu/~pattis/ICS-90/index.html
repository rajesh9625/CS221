Instructors

David G. Kay

Rich Pattis

Course Goals and Plans
The three main goals of ICS 90 are to help new students make a successful
transition to UCI, to build a sense of community in ICS, and to introduce 
new undergrads to the school, some of the faculty, the majors we offer,
and the work we do.

In a typical class session, two faculty members will speak for half an hour
each, about their work and background; David and Rich will then also spend
a half hour addressing more general issues about college life, the field of
computing, and strategies for success in ICS.



Student Expectations

ICS 90 is a one-unit course graded Pass/Not Pass. We have designed it 
not to require much attention outside of the class meetings, but we do
expect every student to attend every class. If you cannot attend class
for any reason, send an email explanation to
Rich Pattis
as soon as possible. 
 It's in class where the learning happens, so you should be present. Before
the first class we will send an email to all our students describing how we
will record attendance electronically.

For issues that come up between class meetings, we have set up a forum at
piazza.com.
Sign yourself up and then
participate by posting
questions or
supplying answers. We may also have opportunities to use Piazza in class
for polls and surveys.
You may bring your phone, tablet, or laptop for attendance-taking and for
using Piazza, but do not use it for other purposes, unless asked by the speaker.
After you check in, please put your devices away.


Seating: Two Classrooms

ICS 90 meets in two rooms at the same time:  BS3 1200 and HSLH 100A.
You are officially enrolled in one section or the other, but ignore which
room you're enrolled in and instead attend in the following room:

* If your class level is FR or SO, come to BS3 1200.
* If your class level is JR or SR, come to HSLH 100A.

This is your official "class level" as shown on WebReg at UCI.

Most weeks, one faculty member will speak starting at 5:00 and another
will speak starting at 5:30. All students are required to be present for
these talks. The third half-hour of each week's class will be devoted to
broader information about college-level work and more. This material
is aimed primarily at new students and is required for those whose class
level is FR or SO. We will have these discussions in BS3 1200 only.
Upper division students (from HSLH 100A) are welcome to attend this
third half-hour (the room is just three minutes away), but they may also
choose to skip it.


Recording Attendance

Bring a phone, tablet, laptop, smart device to class that allows web browsing.

During the lecture we will ask you to navigate to this ICS-90 page and
record that you are attending class by following the Checkin link at the
top of this web page. There you will see a message with instructions about
how to continue. You will eventually enter a word that we will announce
in class.

It is an Academic Integrity violation to run this App and then leave
class early, unless you have an emergency or have arranged permission
beforehand with Rich Pattis. Likewise, you cannot check in for other
students, but you may allow present students to use your device to run
the App.
