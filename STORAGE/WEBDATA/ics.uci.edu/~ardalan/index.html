	  I joined the CS department at UC Irvine in July 2015.
	  I received my M.Sc. and Ph.D. from the ECE department at Rice
	  University, and my B.Sc. from Sharif University of Technology.
	
	
          My research involves building efficient, high performance, and reliable systems.
          I enjoy solving operating system problems related to both mobile devices and datacenter servers.	  
	
      
      Prospective Students
        
	  I'm looking for motivated graduate and undergraduate students who enjoy building systems. If you're interested, send me an email or drop by my office.
