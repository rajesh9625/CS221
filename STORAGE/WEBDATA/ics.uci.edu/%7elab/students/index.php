The ICS Computing Labs are provided for students who are enrolled in
          ICS classes. Before you can begin using the computers in the labs, you
          must first obtain an ICS account. This section will help you with everything
          pertaining to the lab.

        For  more information on troubleshooting, please visit the ICS
          Support page.
        
        MSDNAA Software
        The MSDN
          Academic Alliance helps provide software to students at no cost.
          For more information, please visit the MSDNAA FAQs page.
          If you already have an account, you can proceed to the login
          page.
        Password
        If you've forgotten your password, please see the Lab Assistant in
          CS364. You will be asked for your username and a form of picture ID.
        If you need to change your password, please go here.
          The page is only available from on-campus. If you're off-campus, please
          make sure that you're first connected via the UCI
          VPN.
        Turning in Assignments
        Assignments are turned in one of two ways: masterhit
          dropbox or checkmate.
          Please consult with your syllabus on which procedures you must follow
          for the specific class.
        Openlab Login Problems
        When you login to an ICS host, if you login and get sent back
          to the login screen, then you are either missing system files or you
          are over quota. To check, login to a Windows machine and then use SecureCRT
          to connect to openlab.ics.uci.edu.
        If you can login, then you are probably over quota. Check
            your quota and remove files as necessary. If you cannot login or if you can login but the prompt looks unusual,
            then you are probably missing important files. Please follow the instructions
            on how to Replace UNIX files.
