 Text book
   [Rosen] Kenneth H. Rosen,
      Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications,
      6th edition, McGraw Hill, 2007. 
      This book is required,
      and it should be available at the UCI bookstore.
      Note: There is an online 
list of errata.
  
 Course announcements
   Course announcements will be sent via email to the official
       UCI email address of all students enrolled in the class.
  
 Grading
   Grading will be based on the following weights:
    Final Exam 50%, Quizzes 40%, Homework 10%.
   You may view your ICS 6B assignment grades on EEE Gradebook
   Final Exam: Wednesday of week 11 [Mar 17, 8:00-9:45am]
   Quizzes will be given in Lecture Section,
      generally on Fridays at the start of the class.  
   (Any exceptions will be announced in class.)
   The lowest quiz score will be dropped when computing your quiz average.
   Homework assignments will generally be due Wednesday,
     one minute before the start of the lecture (i.e., at 8:59am).
    Homework is to be submitted on the table in the front of the
    lecture room.
    Late homework, submitted before the end of lecture on the due day,
       will lose half its score.
    The lowest homework score will be dropped when computing
    your homework average.
   Click here for the homework assignments.
    You should be reading sections of the book before
       those sections are discussed in lecture.
    On occasion, there may be homework questions from sections
       of the book not yet covered in lecture.
