CompSci 165: Project in Algorithms and Data StructuresCompSci 165: Project in Algorithms and Data Structures
     Spring 2016 


 Description
    Design, implementation, execution, and analysis of algorithms
      Based on material from ICS 46 and CompSci 161, plus some more
          advanced topics
      The programming language is C/C++ (each student's choice)
      There are 3 required projects, no homework and no examinations
      Prerequisites:
        CompSci 161 / CSE 161.   Recommended: ICS/CSE 45C
   


   Class Meetings
    Lectures M W F 10-10:50am in ICS 180
      Lectures discuss the theory behind the projects,
               as well as some implementation concerns
      The class meets only sporadically during the quarter,
          typically a couple of times for each of the projects
      One-on-one discussions with the instructor
               are available throughout the quarter

   Notes


   Projects
    Compiler considerations for CompSci 165
    Some projects need to measure time usage
    Many projects need a random number generator; 
        I recommend using dshrandom.c
    Do you know the meanings of and distinction between precision and accuracy?
   

  Access to project specifications is limited to enrolled students.
  The user name is your UCInetID (in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS)
  and the password is your student ID number.

 Project 1 – selection of k largest
 Project 2 – majority using group counts





   Communication — If you send me email with course-related questions...
     Include the string "CompSci 165:" at the start of the subject line
       Include your name and UCI Student ID number in the message
       If you are not writing from your official UCI email address,
           please cc your official UCI email address
    
    (This protocol enables me to weed out requests for help
            on problems from non-UCI students.)
