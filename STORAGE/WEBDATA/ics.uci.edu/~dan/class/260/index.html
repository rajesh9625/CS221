   Homework assignments

   Masters Comprehensive Exam
     This course may be used as part of the Comprehensive Exam in the
          computer science masters program.  To pass the Comprehensive Exam,
          students must obtain an A- or better on the 260 Final Exam.
       Students who wish to take the Comprehensive Exam but
          are not enrolled in the course should contact me by email before
          the end of week 2 of the quarter to reserve a seat in the exam.
          Include your full name, UCI Student ID #,
          and which quarter you were previously enrolled in CompSci 260.
          Send the request from your UCI email account (to prevent identity theft).
          Students without reservations will not be permitted to sit for the exam.

   Academic Dishonesty

     Instances of academic dishonesty will be reflected
           in the final grade (usually an F) because dishonesty devalues
           the learning experience for the whole class.
           Additional consequences may occur at the campus level.
       Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to:
           copying from others during an examination
             communicating exam answers with other students during an examination
             using unauthorized materials during an examination
             allowing another student to copy off your work during an  examination
             tampering with an examination after it has been corrected,  then returning it for more credit
          
       For more complete information about academic honesty policies,
           consult the
          
          Academic Senate Policy on Academic Honesty
    

   Communication
       If you send me email with course-related questions:
	 include the string "CompSci 260" at the start of the subject line
	   include your name and UCI Student ID number in the message
	   if you are not writing from your official UCI email address,
	       please cc your official UCI email address
	
	 (This protocol enables me to weed out requests for help
              on problems from non-UCI students)
