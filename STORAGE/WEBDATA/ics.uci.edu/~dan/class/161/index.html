    Grading 
     Policies
       10% -- weekly homework submissions   — lowest homework score is dropped
       20% -- three quizzes   — notification given in a previous class lecture

       30% -- two midterm examinations   — W of week 4, M of week 8
       40% -- final exam   — week 11, F Mar 18 8am

       To pass the course you must pass the final exam and
           have an overall passing average
      Instances of academic dishonesty will be reflected in the final grade
         
          because dishonesty devalues the learning experience for the whole class.
         
          For more complete information about academic honesty policies, consult the
         
          Academic Senate Policy on Academic Honesty
