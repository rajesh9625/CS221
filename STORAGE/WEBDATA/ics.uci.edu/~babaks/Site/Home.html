                  RESEARCH INTEREST
                  My research interest is related to developing new Bayesian methods and applying them to real-world problems. I am currently focusing on the following areas: 
                  
                      1.Scalable Bayesian inference: fast MCMC methods that can be applied to large datasets
                    
                      2.Nonparametric Bayesian models: developing statistical models that are sufficiently flexible
                    
                      3.Statistical Methods in Neuroscience: applying statistical methods to answer research questions in neuroscience
