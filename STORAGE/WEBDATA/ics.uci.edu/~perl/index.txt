							Work Experience
						

						

							
								University of California, Irvine
								Postdoctoral Scholar
								2011-Present
								I perform the day to day activities necessary to run the research lab and advice an average of 10 graduate students in cooperation with another post-doc and the professor. The most important task is the generation of cool, new research ideas. Other activities include grant proposal writing, attending conferences and performing independent research within the areas of compilation, optimization and cyber-security.
							

							
								IBM Haifa Research Labs
								Summer Intern
								July 2010-October 2010
								Worked as a part of the compiler team at the IBM Haifa Research labs. The internship was hosted by Ayal Zaks. Focus was on compiler driven suggestions for source code improvements. Such improvements allow auto-parallelization, auto-vectorization and locality enhancing transformations to succeed.
							

							
								IHPostal A/S
								Lead Software Engineer
								2004-2005
								Lead the planning and subsequent development of a major new revenue protection system for the Norwegian Postal Services. A later version of the system was also adopted by the Danish Postal Services. It is used in production today as the primary means of collecting fees for missing postage on business and private letters of parcels in both Norway and Denmark.
							


							
								Corena Denmark
								Software Engineer
								2004-2005
								Partook in the design and prototyping of an innovative information delivery system to be used in the cockpits of commercial airline companies as a replacement of prior paper-based solutions. 
							

							
								Aston Business Solutions (Mobilized Workforce from '02)
								Software Engineer
								2000-2004
								Participated in the development of a web-based administration systems for a large and well known Danish pension fund, ATP. Solely designed and implemented an electronic self-service system for delivery of take-off data to regional and European airlines with Scandinavian Airline Services as the client. 
							

						
					


					
						
							Education
						
						
							Doctor of Philosophy, Computer Science, 2007-2011
							Technical University of Denmark  - Lyngby, Denmark
							My thesis is about communicating programmer insights about software being developed to the compiler. This leads to better use of compiler optimizations, particularly loop parallelization and vectorization. It also exposes areas for improvement to compiler developers.
						

						
							Master of Science in Engineering Informatics, 1999-2005
							Technical University of Denmark  - Lyngby, Denmark
							The thesis was co-authored by Dr. Peter Verner Bojsen Sørensen with Professor Jan Madsen as the advisor. We implemented, optimized, and tested a system modeling hardware design language–Gezel–on the Microsoft .NET platform.
