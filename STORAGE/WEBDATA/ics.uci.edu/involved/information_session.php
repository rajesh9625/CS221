Information Sessions





On a quarterly basis, the Bren School invites members of the corporate community to Bren Hall to make a recruiting presentation to computing and engineering students. Each information session spotlights one company.
Companies benefit from participation in a number of ways:
Your company receives heightened exposure among Bren School students.Your human resources personnel have the opportunity to meet potential candidates in a relaxed and informal setting.Students receive a chance to educate themselves about your company.
Information sessions are usually scheduled from 12:00 – 1:00 p.m. or 5:00-7:00 p.m. throughout each quarter. During the first 20–30 minutes, company representatives give a general overview of the company, highlighting aspects such as company culture and employment opportunities. The next 15-20 minutes are used as a formal question and answer period. The remaining time is dedicated to informal conversation and resume collection. During this time, students often speak one-on-one with company representatives to ask further questions.
CURRENTLY These sessions are free of charge; however, most companies choose to provide pizza and sodas to encourage student participation.
