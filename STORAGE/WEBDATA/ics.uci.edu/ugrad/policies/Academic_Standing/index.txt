Undergraduate Student Policies




Academic Standing
Students' academic status is reviewed on a quarterly basis. Academic standing is determined by GPA and degree progress. To stay in good standing:
Maintain a quarterly and cumulative GPA above 2.0, andMake progress towards your chosen degree
The Student Affairs Office will notify the student of their academic probation status via their UCI email account.  The letter will include an academic probation contract.  The contract will outline specific conditions that must be met in order to return to good academic standing.
It is the student’s responsibility to:
manage their UCI accountto read and respond to official messages from their academic counselors in a timely manner.monitor academic progress and maintain good academic standing.
Failure to follow through on the steps outlined in your academic probation letter will result in an administrative hold on the student’s record.
Student should contact their academic counselor soon after receiving the academic probation notification to ensure their upcoming course load is reasonable and to learn about helpful campus resources.
 

 
» Academic Probation
Students are subject to probation any time their quarterly or cumulative GPA falls below 2.0, or if they have violated one or more terms of the academic probation contract they are currently on.
**If a student’s term or cumulative GPA falls below a 1.5, the student will be dismissed from the Donald Bren School of ICS effective immediately.  This policy applies to full-time and part-time students.

» Academic Probation Stages
Academic Probation 1
-AP 1 results if the student’s term or cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0.
-Student will be placed on an academic probation contract for the following quarter.
Academic Probation 2 / Subject to Disqualification
-AP 2 results if the student is on two consecutive quarters of academic probation, or has not met one or more terms of the academic probation 1 contract. 
-Student is subject to disqualification
-Student is given the opportunity to appeal the possible / pending disqualification status
*Please note that being subject to disqualification is NOT the same as being formally disqualified

» Submitting a Letter of Appeal
A letter of appeal should explain any unusual or extenuating circumstances that contributed to the student's academic difficulties.  It must also detail the student's plans and actions for effectively addressing these circumstances (including the use of campus resources) so student can return to good academic standing.
The Associate Dean will carefully review the student's appeal letter, transcript and academic file with the academic counselors before making a decision.  Note that the Associate Dean for Student Affairs is the chief academic officer for the Bren School of ICS, and his decisions regarding disqualification appeals are final.
If the appeal is granted, the student will be held to an academic contract that outlines the expectations and timeframe for returning to good academic standing.
If the appeal is denied, the student will be formally disqualified from the major, the Bren School of ICS, and UC Irvine.  
*Instructions on how to appeal, including deadline and where to send the letter will be indicated in the student’s academic probation letter.

» Disqualification
If a student is formally disqualified, he or she will be restricted from registering for courses or using university services after a stated date. The Registrar's Office will also be instructed to note the effective date of the disqualification on the student's official transcript.  An official letter will be sent to the student's permanent address on file.
It is recommended for the student to see an academic counselor to learn about the readmission process and policy.

» Readmission
If a student has been formally disqualified, the student is encouraged to make an appointment to speak with an academic counselor to learn about the readmission policy and to strategize future plans and goals. Please visit the page on Withdrawal and Readmission for additional information.
If / when the student readmits to ICS after having been academically disqualified, the student must for the first quarter of return earn a 2.0 term GPA and Cs or higher in each course.  Failure to meet these terms may result in academic probation or being subject to disqualification.
