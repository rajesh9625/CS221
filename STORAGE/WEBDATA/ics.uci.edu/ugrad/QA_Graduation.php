» Graduation Requirements
You must meet the following requirements:

2.0 GPA cumulative2.0 GPA in your major2.0 GPA in the upper-division courses in your major.

Senior Residency: 36 of the final 45 units completed for the bachelor’s degree must be earned in residence at the UCI campus  (exceptions include courses taken through the Education Abroad Program, the UCDC Academic Internship Program, or the UC Center Sacramento Scholar Intern Program).
If you have any questions about requirements or your degree audit, please meet with a peer advisor or an academic counselor as soon as possible. You should be getting graduation checks at least twice a year as a senior.
Please be aware, however, that students are ultimately responsible for making sure they are on track and indeed meet all graduate requirements.
 
» Applying for Graduation
Graduation is not automatic! You must submit the online Application for Graduation, which is found on Student Access.
Review your degree audit carefully to make sure you will meet all University, Breadth, School and Major requirements. If there is a discrepancy or error, meet with a peer advisor immediately. Do not send an e-mail.
When you fill out the application, be sure to indicate minors, concentrations and specializations that you may be completing. Please also ensure that your diploma notification address and telephone number are correct.
Once the online Application has been submitted, only a Bren School academic counselor may make changes to it.
The Bren School's graduate application deadlines for 2014-15 are as follows. ALL courses must be completed by the end of the quarter in which you intend/apply to graduate.

» Commencement and Honors 

Commencement: Visit the official website of the UCI Commencement Office for full information
Latin Honors: No more than 12% of  seniors graduating during an academic year (summer to spring) will receive Latin honors:
1 percent summa cum laude3 percent magna cum laude8 percent cum laude
Selection is based on the School’s winter quarter, rank-ordered grade point averages. To be eligible for honors at graduation:
You must have an application to graduate on file by the first week of February of the academic year you intend to graduate (e.g. if you are graduating Spring 2010, the application must be submitted by February of that same year)You must be able to verify completion of all course work by the end of spring of the academic year you intend to graduateYou must be officially declared as a Bren School of ICS majorSeventy-two (72) quarter units in residence at a UC campus must be completed by the end of winter quarter of the academic year you intend to graduate. Any corrections to your academic record must be processed by the Registrar's Office by March of the intended graduation year.
Note that latin honors designations are finalized after Spring grades are determined. Students who are eligible for latin honors based on Winter grades may see their designation go up, down, or off the latin honors scale.
Summer graduates participating in the June commencement ceremony prior to their date of graduation are not eligible for honors for that academic year; they will instead be considered for the following academic year.
 
» Transcript and Diploma 
Degrees are posted to official transcripts approximately six to seven weeks after the end of the quarter in which they are conferred. 
Diplomas will be available approximately four months after the quarter in which the degree was awarded.  The Registrar’s Office will notify you by mail when your diploma is available. More information is available on the Registrar's website.
Upon graduation, academic records may not be changed. It is your responsibility to check the accuracy of your academic record, and to resolve all I and NR grades, before you graduate.
