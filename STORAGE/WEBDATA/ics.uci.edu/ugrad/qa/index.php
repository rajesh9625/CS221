General Student Affairs Information


Why and when should I talk to an academic counselor?

Your relationship with the Bren School academic counseling staff typically begins even before you start your first quarter of classes. The counselors will help you clarify your academic goals (including whether you want to add a major, minor, concentration or specialization), map out a plan that leads to completion of all general education and degree requirements by your intended graduation date, and plan your quarterly schedules.
 Add a major, minor, concentration or specialization), map out a plan that leads to completion of all general education and degree requirements by your intended graduation date, and plan your quarterly schedules.As a continuing student, plan to check in at least quarterly, or more often if necessary, with the counseling staff to discuss your academic goals, progress, and challenges. The counselors will inform you about other relevant campus resources, programs, services and opportunities that will complement your personal, social, career or academic goals. 
Both the professional counselors and peer academic advisors have offices in the Student Affairs Office (SAO), located in the ICS building, Suite 352. 
The professional counselors are available by appointment only. You may call (949) 824-5156, or drop by Monday through Friday, between 9-noon and 1-4 pm, to schedule an appointment. 
The peer academic advisors (students who undergo rigorous training and receive close on-site supervision from the professional counselors) are available for drop-in counseling during their posted hours (http://www.ics.uci.edu/~peer/). 
You may also email your question to ucounsel@uci.edu, and an ICS academic counselor will respond as soon as possible. 



Why and when should I talk to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs?

The Associate Dean for Student Affairs (ADSA) holds weekly office hours in the Student Affairs Office.  He is available to talk to students about ways to enrich and broaden their educational experiences through research, internships and work experience, or to hear comments or concerns about particular courses, professors, or the Bren School experience in general.He also meets with students who are petitioning for an exception or waiver from a campus or School policy/requirement, and those who are experiencing serious delays in their academic progress.  
You may schedule an appointment with the Associate Dean by calling the SAO front desk, (949) 824-5156, or by emailing him at adsa@ics.uci.edu.



Where do I obtain the "Dean's signature"?

Always start with the Student Affairs Office (SAO).  Counseling staff are authorized to provide Dean’s review and approval in all instances involving add/drop/grade change enrollment exception requests and other student-related forms issued by the Registrar’s Office or other administrative offices.   In all instances, a student who goes to the Dean’s Office seeking the "Dean’s signature" will be re-directed to the SAO. 
The SAO is open to students from 9-noon and 1-4 p.m., Monday through Friday.  



What if I want to change my major to another one within the Bren School of ICS?

A counselor will review allowed course substitutions (see Note below) and identify the most efficient way to meet the degree requirements for your new intended major.  
Assuming you are eligible to change majors, complete the process by submitting a Change of Major form (available in the ICS Student Affairs Office lobby) and give this to a counselor or the SAO front desk receptionist.  
NOTE:  For the purpose of facilitating a change of major, students who have completed ICS 21 and ICS 22 (or their equivalents) with grades of C or better may use these courses in satisfaction of the requirements of Informatics 41 and 42 (and vice-versa).  Similarly, students who complete ICS 52 with a grade of C or better may use it in satisfaction of Informatics 43 (and vice-versa).  



What if I want to change into a Bren School major from another School at UCI?

The Change of Major guidelines for Business Information Management, Computer Science, Computer Science and Engineering, Informatics or Information and Computer Science are listed at the Change of Major web site.
We encourage you to meet with an ICS academic counselor as soon as possible.  They will help you structure a revised academic plan and determine the most efficient use of coursework-to-date to meet degree and general education requirements.  
Once you have successfully met the Bren School of ICS change of major requirements, please do the following: 
a. Complete and submit a Change of Major form (available in the ICS Student Affairs Office lobby, your major's Student Affairs Office, and the Registrar's office) to the receptionist at the ICS Student Affairs Office.
b. If you have over 120 units, also include an academic plan detailing the courses remaining and your intended graduation date (quarter and year).  
c. Please note that our Double Major policy is entirely different from our Change of Major policy. Please see an ICS academic counselor immediately if you are interested in adding a second or third major.




What if I want to change from a Bren School major into a major in another School at UCI?

All campus change of major policies are located online at the Change of Major web site.
You should meet with an academic counselor in the School of your intended major as soon as possible to receive guidance about the most efficient way to apply earned units toward general education and "intended" major requirements. 



Can I double major, and what are the restrictions?

If you are considering a double major, schedule an appointment with an academic counselor to find out how to most efficiently meet the additional degree requirements.A counselor will also help you map out an academic plan that will keep you on track with your intended timeline to graduation.A double major may not be added during a student’s senior year at UCI; instead, a student is directed to consider a Second Baccalaureate program in CS, ICS or Informatics.BREN SCHOOL DEGREE PROGRAM RESTRICTIONS:
Students majoring in Business Information Management may not double major in Business Administration nor minor in Management, Informatics, or Information and Computer Science.The major in Biomedical Computing may not be combined with the minor in Information and Computer Science.The major or minor in Information and Computer Science (ICS) cannot be combined with the majors in Computer Game Science (CGS), Computer Science (CS), Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), or Informatics.The major in Computer Science (CS) cannot be combined with the major in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).The major in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) cannot be combined with the major in Computer Engineering (offered by The Henry Samueli School of Engineering). Bren School of ICS majors may not minor in Informatics.Bren School of ICS majors may not minor in Digital Information Systems. Courses used to complete the minor in Digital Information Systems may not also count towards the requirements for the Information and Computer Science minor or the Informatics minor.

For additional information about double majoring, please consult the individual degree information pages.
 



How do I declare a minor?

If you are interested in adding a Bren School minor, see your Academic Counselor and be sure to have your him or her post the minor to your online Degree Audit located on your Student Access page.
If you are interested in adding a minor outside of the Bren School, check with the School that is offering the minor. 
Most academic units do not require you to declare a minor. However, you may be asked to fill out an "Intent to Pursue the Minor" form which allows the academic unit to plan for course offerings for non-majors but in no way obligates you to finish the minor.
Some schools, such as the Paul Merage School of Management (management and accounting minors), and the Claire Trevor School of the Arts (digital arts minor), may limit the number of students that are accepted into their minor degree programs, or may require that you make academic progress within a certain timeframe.



Where do I find information on graduate schools?

The UCI Career Center offers a range of services regarding graduate school research, preparation and application (including an on-line Letter of Recommendation service).  
The Career Center also has a library of resource materials that are helpful for graduate school research (e.g. the Peterson’s Guide to Graduate Programs (www.petersons.com), program brochures, and campus catalogues. 
Find out more at the Career Center web site.  
After reading about the Bren School's graduate degree programs, you may also talk to one of the Bren School's graduate counselors to learn more about your academic preparedness and suitability for graduate work.Bren ICS graduate counselors hold drop-in hours Monday – Friday, 1-3:30 pm; their offices are located in ICS 1, Suite 352.



Degree and Course Planning


How do I get into the Bren School of ICS Honors Program?

The Bren School Honors Program provides an opportunity for selected students in any one of the Bren School majors to pursue advanced work in one of the research areas in the School. 
Admission to the program is based on a formal application submitted to the School in the spring. Applications are available each year beginning May 1 and should be submitted by June 1 to ensure consideration. Students are notified during August and September since spring and summer (if applicable) grades are considered.
Major-specific courses and GPA requirements are listed at the Bren School Honors Opportunities Program page.
In selecting students for the honors program, the School also considers evidence of ability and interest in research. 
Students admitted to the program participate in the Bren School Honors Seminar (ICS H197), which provides an introduction to research areas in the School, followed by a minimum of two quarters of independent supervised research (CS H198 or Informatics H198).
Passing two H198s counts for one of the project courses required for the ICS and CS majors, provided that at least one of the remaining two project courses is taken in a different area. 
In order for the student to be considered to have successfully completed the honors program, the work must be written up as a final report and certified to be of honors quality by the student’s faculty advisor and the Honors Program advisor.



What is a degree check and how do I request one?

A degree check is an evaluation of your progress towards your degree – what requirements you have fulfilled and which you still must complete. 
It includes an evaluation of all of your records – AP credits, UCI work, courses taken at other colleges and universities. 
All students should schedule a degree check at least once per year. Seniors must meet with a Bren School academic counselor to get a degree check at least 1-2 quarters before their intended graduation date (example, if you are aiming to graduate at the end of spring quarter, you must schedule a Degree Check during fall or winter quarter).  
Stop by the Bren School SAO during office hours or call (949) 824-5156 to set up an appointment with a counselor (or see a Peer Advisor during drop-in hours).



Which courses must I take for a grade?

All major requirements must be taken for a letter grade. This includes courses listed below for the specific major.  
Business Information Management: Computer Science, Economics, Informatics, ICS, Management, Mathematics, Statistics
Computer Science: Computer Science, ICS (including ICS 139W), Mathematics, 3-quarter Physics, Chemistry or Biology sequence, Statistics 67, Philosophy 29 or 30
Computer Science/Engineering: Computer Science, Computer Science and Engineering, ICS, Mathematics, Philosophy 29, Physics 7 series, Statistics 67, and any science elective

ICS Undeclared (Pre-major): Computer Science, Informatics, ICS, Mathematics, Philosophy 29, Science (if you are considering CS or CSE) and Statistics 



Which courses may I take P/NP?

General education requirements and electives not applicable to your major requirements may be taken P/NP. 



How many units may I take P/NP?

You may take an average of 4 units P/NP per quarter and no more than 12 units TOTAL as P/NP during your undergraduate career. 
The P/NP grading option may be used only for courses that count for the unit requirement for the bachelor’s degree and toward the general education requirement. 
Unless designated as 'P/NP Only,' courses taken to complete Bren School or major requirements must be taken for a letter grade. 
No more than two courses may be taken P/NP and applied to any minor on campus.



May I take classes at a community college after I have matriculated to UCI?

Bren School students who have matriculated may petition to take up to four approved UC-transferable lower-division classes, except for writing classes, at a community college or other university.
You must consult www.assist.org to find courses that are UC-transferable. 
It is extremely important to consult with a Bren School academic counselor prior to taking off-campus courses, and especially if you are near or in your last year prior to graduation. 
The counselor will review your list of proposed courses to ensure that they will count towards your general education or major requirements and will not compromise your ability to meet the UCI residence requirement (at least 36 of the final 45 units completed must be earned in residence at the UCI campus; certain exceptions may apply). 



How can I take more than 20 units? 

Freshman entering their first quarter at UCI and the Bren School cannot enroll in more than 20 units. 
After the first quarter, any student with the most recent quarterly GPA and a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher may enroll in more than 20 units, with prior authorization from an academic counselor in the Bren ICS Student Affairs Office (ICS 1, Suite 352).  



What is the "UCI residence requirement"?

All students are required to complete at least 36 of the final 45 units preceding graduation while in residence at UCI. 
Exceptions may be allowed for students who participate in certain programs, such as EAP, UCDC, or IOP. 



Preparation for Graduation


What is a degree audit and how do I get one?

A degree audit is an online report that students use as a guide to construct their academic plans.  Here, you will see an audit of your progress toward your degree requirements.  To access your audit online, go to:  www.uci.edu > student access > degree audit > sign in 
It is important that you monitor your degree audit for accuracy as the ICS Student Affairs Office uses it to determine satisfaction of degree requirements for graduation purposes.
If there are omissions or errors, please meet with an academic counselor or peer advisor.  Changes to the degree audit must be done in person; requests via e-mail or phone will not be accommodated.   
If your degree audit is not posted, please send an e-mail toucounsel@uci.edu with your request.



How and when do I apply to graduate?

You apply to graduate by submitting an online Application for Graduation via Student Access no later than the published deadline for the intended quarter. 
Bren School’s deadline is week 10 of the quarter prior to that quarter in which you will complete all required coursework for graduation.
Applications for the spring quarter must be turned in by the end of week 10 of winter quarter to ensure consideration for Latin honors at graduation and inclusion in the commencement program. 
Included on the Application are spaces to indicate minors, concentrations and specializations that you may be completing.
After submitting the online Application, only a Bren School academic counselor may make changes to it. Therefore, please ensure that your diploma notification address and telephone number are correct.

How do I find out if I am eligible for Latin Honors?

Of the seniors graduating during an academic year (summer to spring), no more than 12 percent of the graduating class will receive Latin honors:
» 1 percent summa cum laude» 3 percent magna cum laude» 8 percent cum laude
The selection for these awards is based on the School’s winter quarter rank-ordered grade point averages. To be eligible for honors at graduation:
» You must file an application to graduate by the first week of February of the academic year you intend to graduate (e.g. if you are graduating spring 2010, the application must be submitted by February of the same year)
» You must be able to verify completion of all course work by the end of spring of the academic year you intend to graduate and be officially declared as a Bren School of ICS major
» Seventy-two (72) quarter units in residence at a UC campus must be completed by the end of winter quarter of the academic year you intend to graduate.  In addition, any corrections to your academic record must be processed by the Registrar's Office by March of the same year.
NOTE:  Summer graduates participating in the June commencement ceremony prior to their date of graduation are not eligible for honors for that academic year but will be considered for the following academic year instead.




Policies, Practices, and Deadlines
NOTE:Effective Fall 2010, paper add/drop cards will no longer be used nor will they be processed by the Registrar's Office.  All enrollment requests past the deadlines listed below will be considered LATE and will require exceptional review either by the school offering the course and/or the student's home school; there is no guarantee that an enrollment exceptions request will be approved.  Plan your schedule and courseload carefully.  If you have questions, contact an SAO counselor in advance of the general campus deadlines outlined below.

Drop a course by the end of week 2 (or the earlier, unique course deadline set by the instructor)Change the grading option by the end of week 2 (or the earlier, unique course deadline set by the instructor)Add a course by the end of week 3 (or the earlier, unique course deadline set by the instructor)


Where do I obtain the "Dean’s signature"?
Always start with the Bren ICS Student Affairs Office (SAO) – located in ICS, Suite 352 – and open to students from 9-noon and 1-4 p.m. Monday through Friday. Counselors are authorized to provide Dean’s review and signature in all instances involving LATE add/drop/change of grading option requests done via the on-line Enrollment Exceptions system, and on other student-related forms issued by the Registrar’s Office or other administrative offices.


When is the last day to add a Bren School class?

The general campus deadline to add an undergraduate course is the end of the 3rd week of classes.  An earlier course add deadline may be imposed by the instructor, so be sure to carefully read WebSOC notes and the course syllabus. A request to add a course AFTER the unique course deadline or the end of week 3 must be initiated using the on-line Enrollment Exceptions system, and will require review and approvals by the course instructor, the Dean of the School that is offering the course and the Dean of the School that houses your major.  



When is the last day to drop a Bren School class?

﻿The general deadline to drop an undergraduate course is the end of the 2nd week of classes.  An earlier course drop deadline may be imposed by the instructor, so be sure to carefully read WebSOC notes and the course syllabus. 
A request to drop a course AFTER the unique course deadline or the end of week 2 must be initiated using the on-line Enrollment Exceptions system, and will require review and approvals by the Dean of the School that is offering the course and the Dean of the School that houses your major.  
Not doing well in a course is generally not considered a valid reason for a late drop petition, so please select your courses carefully.  As a courtesy to your professor, please let him or her know once you have dropped th course.



When is the last day to change a grade option for a Bren School class?

The general campus deadline to change a grade option in an undergraduate course is the end of the 2nd week of classes.  An earlier course deadline to change the grading option may be imposed by the instructor, so be sure to carefully read WebSOC notes and the course syllabus.  A request to change a grading option AFTER the unique course deadline or the end of week 2 must be initiated using the on-line Enrollment Exceptions system, and will require review and approvals by the course instructor, the Dean of the School that is offering the course and the Dean of the School that houses your major.
Not doing well in a course is generally not considered a valid reason for a late request to change a grading option, so please plan carefully.
Bren School majors may take only the following Bren School courses for P/NP grade option:  ICS 90, ICS 93, ICS 139W (except CS majors), CS 190 or Informatics 190 (as long as the 190 will not apply toward degree requirements), ICS H197, CS or Informatics H198 (as long as the H198 will not apply toward degree/honors requirements), and CS or Informatics 199 (as long as the 199 will not apply toward degree requirements).
Students who are pursuing a minor in Biomedical Computing, Informatics, ICS and Statistics may take up to two courses with a P/NP grade option to satisfy their minor requirements.  Please keep in mind that taking too many classes as P/NP is not looked highly upon by graduate schools.



When/How/Where do I petition for an exception to policy?

The Bren School Student Affairs Office has a form entitled "Undergraduate Student Petition." 
You must complete this form to petition for a course substitution or waiver, to seek credit for major or general education courses taken at a college for which there is no articulation agreement, to waive the residence requirement, or when asking for an exception to an administrative decision, policy or deadline. 
In situations where an exception to degree requirements or policy is being requested, the Bren School counselors will inform you about the type of information and documentation that is needed, and will submit your completed request for review by the School’s Associate Dean for Student Affairs (ADSA). 



What are the requirements for part-time status and how do I apply?

You are eligible for part-time status if you meet one of these conditions:  working 30 or more hours a week (this requires documentation), have health problems, or have significant family responsibilities.  
In order to apply, please come into the ICS Student Affairs Office to fill out a part-time status form.  An academic counselor will review and discuss your request, and sign your form if approved. 
Signed part-time petitions must be processed by the Registrar's Office no later than Friday of the 3rd week of classes - there are no exceptions to this policy.



How does a "W" (Withdrawal) affect my GPA?

The "W" notation is placed on a student’s transcript when a course is dropped after the end of the sixth week. 
It is not computed in the GPA. Please note that a withdrawal is not commonly allowed by the Bren School and requires verifiable documentation.  See the section “Bren School Drop Policy and Deadlines” (above).



What does it mean to be on academic probation?

You are subject to probation any time your quarterly or cumulative GPA falls below 2.0. 
The Student Affairs Office will notify you of your probation status by email to your UCI account and U.S. mail to your permanent address, and will specify conditions that must be met to return to good academic standing (quarterly and cumulative GPAs above 2.0).  The conditions constitute a “contract” that outlines specific academic progress expectations and a timeframe by which you must return to good academic standing.   
Contact your Bren School academic counselor soon after your probation notification to ensure that your academic plan is reasonable and to learn about campus resources and success strategies that may be helpful. 
It is your responsibility to manage your UCI account and to read and respond to official messages from your academic counselors in a timely manner. Failure to follow through on the steps outlined in your probation letter may result in an administrative hold being placed on your record.



What does it mean to be "subject to disqualification"?

A student who fails to meet the conditions of an academic contract after two consecutive quarters, OR whose GPA falls below 1.5 for any quarter, will be notified that he/she is “subject to disqualification” (note:  this is a preliminary step in the review and decision-making process – it is NOT the same as being “formally disqualified”).  Official notification will be sent from the Bren School’s Associate Dean for Student Affairs to the student’s UCI email address and by certified letter to the student’s permanent address. 
The notification letter provides instructions for appealing the disqualification action. All students are strongly encouraged to appeal the disqualification by submitting a letter to the Associate Dean,adsa@ics.uci.edu.  This appeal letter should explain any unusual or extenuating circumstances that contributed to the student’s academic difficulties and detail the student’s plans and actions for effectively addressing these circumstances (including the use of campus resources).  The Associate Dean will carefully review the student’s appeal letter, transcript and academic file with the counselors before making a decision.  If the appeal is granted, the student will be held to an academic contract that outlines the expectations and timeframe for returning to good academic standing.  If the appeal is not granted, the student will be formally disqualified (this means dismissed from the major, the Bren School of ICS, and UC Irvine) and restricted from registering for courses or using university services after a stated date.  The Registrar’s Office will also be instructed to note the effective date of the disqualification on the student’s official transcript.  
The Associate Dean for Student Affairs is the chief academic officer for the Bren School of ICS; therefore, his decisions regarding disqualification appeals are FINAL. 



What is the readmission policy?

Readmission to UCI and the Bren School of ICS is NOT automatic.  
Please visit this link for more information about fees, procedures and deadlines.
The Readmission Application Form is available at Registrar's Office or the Bren School Student Affairs Office.  
Bren School Student Affairs Office requires additional documentation for consideration of readmission. 
All materials required for readmission petition must be submitted to the Bren School Student Affairs Office as a complete package. An academic counselor will attach a summary of previous course work and/or contract conditions for the Associate Dean’s consideration. 
Only UC-transferable courses (www.assist.org) will be considered when determining a student’s eligibility for readmission to one of the Bren School majors.
The Associate Dean for Student Affairs will consider the applicant’s number of completed units while at UCI, number of units remaining for completion of general education and degree requirements, grades for coursework taken at other institutions or through ACCESS UCI, and demonstrated readiness for the academic challenge of UCI coursework. 
A readmitted student who has not been enrolled at UCI for three or more consecutive quarters must adhere to the graduation requirements: (a) in effect for the quarter in which the student is readmitted; or (b) those subsequently established.
Readmission to the Bren School after voluntary withdrawal from UCI while in good standing:Readmission will be automatic if the student re-enrolls within one year and will otherwise be considered on a case by case basis. 
A readmission petition can be submitted at the same time as a withdrawal form is filed. 
If known, students should indicate their intended quarter of re-entry at the time of withdrawal.
Readmission to the Bren School after voluntary withdrawal from UCI while student is on Academic Probation:In certain situations, the Bren School may approve a student’s time-limited withdrawal if it becomes evident that doing so will prevent further damage to the student’s academic record. 
Conditions for readmission in this case would be discussed at the time of withdrawal; any academic contract conditions in place at the time of withdrawal would remain in effect upon the student’s return.
The UCI readmission application must be accompanied by:
1) A written statement no longer than 2 pages that details the reason(s) for leaving, the reason(s) for returning (including new or renewed interest/focus on Bren School major), and ways that previous or existing obstacles to academic progress have been addressed and will be addressed in the future.
2) An official transcript showing completion of at least 1 full-time quarter or semester of transferable courses in Computer Science or mathematics with a GPA satisfying the conditions specified in the student’s academic contract.
Readmission to the Bren School after academic disqualification:The Associate Dean will consider the number of units remaining towards breadth and major degree requirements. 
In general, a student applying for readmission will need to demonstrate that he/she can finish remaining coursework within a timeframe that does not violate university policies regarding excessive units (see Catalogue, “UCI Policy on Excessive Units” for more information). 
A student readmitted after academic disqualification will be held to the conditions of a two quarter contract specifying a course plan, unit maximum per quarter, GPA expectations, and mandatory advising sessions. 
Failure to meet the contract conditions for any of two quarters may lead to automatic disqualification.
The UCI readmission application must be accompanied by:
1) A written statement no longer than 2 pages that details the reason(s) for leaving, the reason(s) for returning (including new or renewed interest/focus on Bren School major), and ways that previous or existing obstacles to academic progress have been addressed and will be addressed in the future.
2) An official transcript showing completion of a minimum of one full-time academic year of courses taken through UCI Extension (ACCESS), a community college or another comparable institution. 
At least six of these courses must meet major requirements (includes math courses). 
The overall GPA for this year of work must be at least a 2.5. In some cases the requirement that a full year of coursework be completed elsewhere can be waived, if there is considerable evidence that the student is fully prepared to return to UCI full time.
3) If the student intends to petition for a Change of Major into or out of the Bren School upon readmission, he/she must submit a completed Change of Major form.
4) Students considering applying for readmission after academic disqualification are strongly encouraged to meet with an academic counselor well in advance of preparing their application.
