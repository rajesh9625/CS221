Second Baccalaureate Degrees




For students whose first degree was from another institution other than UC Irvine:
Applications will be accepted for the Fall quarter only. Applications must be submitted during the filing period in order to be considered for Fall admission. Detailed information on the application procedure can be found on the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools website.
For students whose first degree was completed at UC Irvine:
Applications will be accepted for any quarter. Former UC Irvine students must meet with an academic counselor to discuss admission for the second baccalaureate.

» Tips for Second Baccalaureate Applicants
Applications cannot be considered or activated until all required coursework is completed and relevant transcripts are received.
Required coursework may be completed at UCI or with equivalent courses taken at an accredited institution. Courses taken at a four-year or two-year institution can be examined by UC Irvine faculty through a petition process to determine equivalency. In order to determine equivalency, a course syllabus/outline with a course description, weekly topics, and a textbook (if necessary) must be submitted to syllabi@ics.uci.edu
Courses may be taken at UCI through ACCESS UCI via University Extension. For more information about ACCESS and the process, contact an ICS academic counselor.
Courses taken at universities other than local community colleges should be evaluated for equivalency before submitting your application to ensure you have completed all relevant coursework. Articulation agreements between California community colleges and the Bren School of ICS can be found at www.assist.org.
Grade point averages as stated in the policy are required. If you complete several math and computer science courses and find you are not earning high enough grades, you may need to reconsider your decision to apply for a second baccalaureate degree in ICS. You may decide not to finish the required course work if you will not be able to get into ICS. The academic counselors in ICS are available to discuss your chances of being admitted to the program and to help you to identify other options.
