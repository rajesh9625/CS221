Physics 7C-D and 7LC-LD: This is a two quarter sequence in classical physics. It is a sequence designed for engineering majors and covers force, energy, momentum, roation, and gravity, and electricity and magnetism.
CSE 41 and 42: This is the UCI introductory sequence in computer science and engineering. It covers history, computer system fundamentals, productivity tools, an introduction to programming and problem solving, and literacy topics in computer science.
