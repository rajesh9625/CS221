	        This quarter (Winter 2016), I am teaching
		CS 261, graduate data structuresCS 269, theory seminar

                Courses I have offered in other quarters:
                ICS 1F, computability
		(last offered W98)US 3, cellular automata
		(last offered W07)ICS 161, design and analysis of
                algorithms
		(last offered F15)ICS 162, formal languages and
		automata
		(last offered F03)CS 163 / CS 265, graph algorithms
		(last offered W15)CS 164, computational geometry
		(last offered S14)ICS 180, game programming
		project (last offered W99)ICS 260, fundamentals of
		algorithms
		(last offered F02)ICS 261, graduate data structures
		(last offered W11)CS 263, analysis of algorithms.
		(last offered W15)CS 266,  computational geometry,
		(last offered S14)
		In addition I have occasionally offered graduate seminars,
                under the ICS 280 and CS 295 course numbers, but with
		a different topic each time; past topics include
                mesh generation (S97),
                computational statistics (S99),
                exponential algorithms (F00),
		and
		geometric graph algorithms (W07 and S08).
