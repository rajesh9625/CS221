                I am a Chancellor's Professor in the
		Computer
                Science Department of the University of
		California, Irvine.

		

                My research (see selected publications) has covered many topics in
                computational geometry and graph algorithms, including:

                Graph drawing and information visualizationDynamic graph algorithms and dynamic closest pair
		  data structuresMesh generation and optimal triangulationK-shortest paths and related combinatorial
		  enumeration algorithms

		  Subgraph isomorphism and network statisticsData depth and robust statisticsExponential-time algorithms for NP-hard problemsDistance-preserving embeddings of graphs and
		  metric spaces

                I am also an avid photographer and have many
                photos in my web photo
                gallery.

                My name is not uncommon (although the spelling
                is atypical); see my page of Eppsteins on the net if you
                think you've reached the wrong me.
