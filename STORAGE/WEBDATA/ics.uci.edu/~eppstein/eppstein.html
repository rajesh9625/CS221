to the U.S. from Germany in 1854 (approximately). Two sisters, Charlotte
and Rosalie, remained behind. Rosalie married a man named Simon. Their
grandson became the managing director of Rosenthal China. Charlotte
married Heinrich Guttman and had at least one son , Otto. Their son,
Harvey Guttman lives in the U.S.  The brothers settled in Saint Joseph,
Missouri and owned a soap factory. The factory burned down and Leopold
and Elias moved to Texas (perhaps Sherman, Texas). Max (4/1825-4/1903
moved to Denver and he and his wife, Bertha Herzberg (10/1837-2/1912)
had seven children: Seraphene, Julia, Helen, Carrie, Arthur, and twin
girls, Lily and May.  Arthur, the only son married Viola Strauss. They
had two children, Helen and Lily and, thus the Max Eppstein branch name
was lost. ...  I would love to find out about the families of Leopold
and Elias, but have been unsuccessful to date."The Arthur
Eppstein Insurance Achievement Award was likely named after Arthur
(above), who owned Oregon Automobile and Causality Company in Portland.
