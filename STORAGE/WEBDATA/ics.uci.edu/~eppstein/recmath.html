                Like many, I was inspired early on by Martin Gardner's Mathematical
                Games column, which included a mixture of puzzles, silliness,
                curious/useless math, and quite serious (but not overly technical)
                math. In that spirit, I've collected many pages and links of
                recreational math web sites.
                
                My
                    recreational math publications.Number Theory. Implementations
                    of some simple number-theoretic algorithms along with pointers to
                    other number theory web pages.Combinatorial Game Theory. Mathematical
                    strategies for games like chess, go, and nim.The Geometry Junkyard.
                    Many links to recreational geometry web pages, open problem lists,
                    lecture notes, usenet postings, and
                    brief blurbs from my own papers.  For more serious geometry links,
                    see my Geometry in Action pages.Gliders in "Life"-like cellular automaton
                    rules.
