                  The world is continuing to shrink as social computing grows. Never before have people been able to connect to others and to information sources so rapidly and on such a global scale. This is a fascinating time to study how technology use affects people. My research interest is in what is known as social computing: studying how individuals, groups, society and technology mutually influence each other. I am particularly interested in studying how information technology use affects multi-tasking, attention, mood, and above all, stress. Rather than bring people into a laboratory to study, I go to where people are--the real world is a living laboratory. To study people and their technology use, I employ a method called precision tracking, which involves a combination of sensors, bio-sensors, experience sampling, surveys, and ethnographic techniques to gain a very detailed, comprehensive, and in-depth understanding of what people experience when they use computer technology. I study real-world technology usage in the workplace and also with college students, who are of the Millennial Generation, who grew up with the Internet. I also study how people use social media and computer systems to be resilient during and after environmental crises. I invite you to take a closer look at some of the projects that my students and I are involved in.
