Software has transformed society in dramatic and powerful ways; 
software systems inform, control and enhance daily activities.

          Software research at the Bren School is aimed at 
creating new software technology and solutions, furthering the 
information revolution.

          The central goal of this research is improvement in 
software development, evolution, deployment, quality, understandability 
and
             cost-effectiveness.

          A unifying theme of the software engineering research 
group is software architecture.

          Specific research emphases within this area include:

             Hypermedia
                Analysis and testing
                Software understanding
                Environments and user-interface software
                Process/workflow
                Distributed component-based systems
                Extensible systems
                Mobile code
                Software architecture
                WWW technology and protocols
