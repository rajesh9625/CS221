Research in databases and data mining addresses exciting research 
challenges related to architectures, index structures,
             algorithms, models, and performance evaluation of a variety
 of next-generation databases and information systems and technologies
             for data mining. Current topics of interest include 
database systems, data analysis and data cleansing, data warehousing 
systems,
             information integration tools, search techniques, scalable 
data-intensive computing, data sharing, data dissemination, and
             statistical data mining. Current projects are exploring 
challenges in the realization of such systems stemming from data volume,
             complexity, diversity, and heterogeneity, and emerging 
application needs including privacy and security, mobility, quality of 
data,
             quality of service, and reliability and robustness in 
extreme situations.

             http://isg.ics.uci.edu
 (for databases and next-generation information systems)
             and
