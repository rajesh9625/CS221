Embedded Systems are ubiquitous and range from small devices (e.g., 
motion sensors or smart phones) to large systems-of-systems
             (e.g., airplanes or hybrid cars).  The convergence of 
multiple trends -- including rapid miniaturization of computer 
electronics
             and advances in software development and connectivity  -- 
enable embedded software and hardware to monitor, compute and control
             a wide array of physically engineered systems. Numerous 
examples of such products exist in the automotive, telecom, bio-medical,
             avionics, consumer electronics, and other industries. 

          Embedded systems must often deliver functionality within 
tight constraints (e.g., real-time, power, and reliability). 
Additionally,
             safety-critical embedded systems must deliver provably 
correct behavior when interfacing with physical sensors and actuators 
that
             interact with the environment.  Thus research in embedded 
systems is highly interdisciplinary in nature, requiring a tight
             integration of core CS principles with domain specific 
knowledge of the end application/environment. 

          Researchers at the Bren School cover a broad range of 
embedded systems research topics, including topics such as embedded 
software,
             architectures for embedded computer systems, design 
automation, embedded systems methodologies, validation and verification,
 formal
             methods, and cyber-physical systems.

             Center for Embedded 
Computer Systems.
