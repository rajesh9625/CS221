This research area focuses on "Systems Software," the pervasive software infrastructure that makes the development and use of applications possible, and on the programming languages that are used for creating software. Among the topics being studied are programming languages, compilers, operating systems and networking software.  


Research in the Programming Languages and Systems area frequently emphasizes a practical element in addition to theoretical rigor. New ideas are not just studied on paper but implemented as research prototypes, which can then be measured under realistic conditions.  


Some of the specific research interests of Bren School faculty in this area include:  

Program restructuring and transformation techniques for parallelization and distribution 
   Compilers for high-performance computing 

   Web 2.0+ technologies such as AJAX, JavaScript, Python and Ruby

    Just-in-time compilation and optimization 

   Mobile code representations, distribution and optimization 

   Cloud computing software infrastructure 

   Memory management
