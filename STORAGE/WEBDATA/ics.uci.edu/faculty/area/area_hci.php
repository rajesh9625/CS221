HCI research at UCI stretches from the architecture of novel interactive systems to the social and cultural considerations of information technology adoption and use. We employ laboratory, ethnographic, and prototyping techniques to understand how people adopt, adapt, and respond to information systems. Recent research has investigated privacy issues in mobile systems, tangible interfaces for group awareness, interactive animation, and visualization of location information.
