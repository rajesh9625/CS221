Course Goals
Using the Java language students will learn the properties and implementation details of the fundamental data
structures (arrays, lists, queues, stacks, dictionaries, hashtables, trees, graphs) that often are at the heart
of any program. Students will also learn basic problem solving methods, such as divide and conquer, separate and
conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, tree and search algorithms as well as some useful applications.
As part of the coding assigments, students will be expected to analyse their code and follow good object-oriented
design. 


Grading
There will be four programming assignments, 4 quizzes and a final. The course is not graded on a curve. Roughly
the homeworks count 40%, the quizzes 20%, and the final 40%. I don't use a formula to assign grades. Trends matter.
You need to pass both the homeworks and the final to pass the class. The lowest quiz score will be dropped. If
you can't make a quiz, then that quiz is the one that is dropped. The coding assignments will be in Java. Roughly,
the exams and homeworks will count equally. The final exam will be based on the text, lecture notes, and homeworks.
Each chapter ends with a summary. Be sure that you know every concept discussed in the summary. The fastest way
to get questions answered is to email either the TAs or me. Answers of general interest will be posted on the bulletin
board (ics.23). You may also use the bulletin board to ask classmates for appropriate help. Any form of inappropriate
help will result in an F grade in the class and a letter in your file. If you are unsure whether the type of help
you are seeking is appropriate, imagine that you are video taped and the tape was shown to me.
The homeworks focus on using arrays, lists, trees, hashing, and sorting.
Grades are posted at: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~javid/ICS23/grades.htm.


Knowledge Prerequisites
You should be familiar with arrays, linked lists, and (unbalanced) binary trees.
By familiar I mean that you have implemented these data structures and are confident with dealing with them. Additional
you should have the a rudimentary knowledge of O-notation, in particular the ability to analyze programs that involve
multiple loops, but not programs that involve recursion. It is also expected that you are familiar with Java, but
not with Gui interfaces. My experience is that students who know C++ can learn enought of Java in just a few hours
to write programs required for this class.

Current class questions/answer are put on the newsgroup bulletin board ics23.
Note: Questions asked after 4pm on Friday are not guaranteed to be answered. Sometimes I take the weekends
off.
Note: Because of time constraints in the summer, no understanding of proofs will be necessary. They are
in the notes for those who are interested.

Week 3 Priority Queues & Hashing


	Heaps, array representations, collisions

You should know the complexity of the algorithms/methods that we have covered in class. You should also understand
	how the algorithms work and be able to illustrate what they do. For example, given a specific binary tree you should
	be able to show the changes in the tree that would remove a specific element.
