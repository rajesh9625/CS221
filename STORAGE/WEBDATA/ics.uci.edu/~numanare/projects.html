Non-convex Robust PCA (Code)
Sample results on the task of foreground-background separation in the restaurant video dataset:






From left to right: Original video, non-convex low-rank, non-convex sparse







From left to right: Vanilla PCA, convex low-rank, convex sparse


Note that our non-convex method is superior in the quality of the foreground-background separation (for example, notice that artifacts are not present in our method when compared a
gainst convex method), for a given accuracy, and has much faster running times (refer to the paper for more details).
