News

 A paper accepted to TOCS with minor revision.



 
PerfBlower was released! 
If you work on dynamic analysis but do not want to hack JVM, try our
instrumentation specification language (ISL) in PerfBlower. Read
our ECOOP'15 paper for details.



 One idea
paper was accepted to PLOS'15 (colocated with
SOSP'15). Congratulations to Khanh and Lu!


 The ''interruptible task'' paper was accepted to SOSP'15. Congratulations to  Lu and Khanh!


GraphQ is publicly available! Try it if you have a very large graph but only want to know information about a small number of vertices and edges.


The GraphQ paper was
accepted to USENIX ATC'15. Congratulations to Kai!


The PerfBlower paper was
accepted to ECOOP'15. Congratulations to Lu!


The Facade paper was accepted to ASPLOS'15. Congratulations to Khanh and everyone else in the group!



Congratulations to Khanh for winning the third prize (bronze medal) in the ACM Student Research Competition at PLDI'14.



A new collaborative grant
awarded from NSF CCF to support my research on performance debugging and testing.



A new (sole-PI) grant
awarded from ONR to support my research on automated data structure
replacement.



A paper accepted to TOSEM.

A paper accepted to CGO'14.

A paper accepted to ASE'13.

A new (sole-PI) grant awarded from NSF CNS.

We have released Resurrector, a new object lifetime profiling tool!
Please read our OOPSLA'13 paper for details. 

We have released our demand-driven
context-sensitive alias analysis! This analysis gives you better
performance as it does not need to perform a points-to
analysis first. 

Our Big Data design paper got a Chinese transaltion!


One paper accepted to ESEC/FSE'13.
Congratulations to Khanh, who has a top conference paper before finishing the
first year!

One paper accepted to OOPSLA'13.

All the talk slides for the
pre-OOPSLA-PC-meeting workshop can be found here. Thanks to all the contributing
PC members!

One paper accepted to ISSTA'13.

One paper accepted to ISMM'13.

One paper accepted to ECOOP'13.


About Me

I am an assistant professor in the computer
science department of University of
California, Irvine. 

My research interests range from software engineering,
through programming languages and compilers, to runtime/operating/distributed
systems. I am recently interested in building scalable and low-latency Big Data systems.
