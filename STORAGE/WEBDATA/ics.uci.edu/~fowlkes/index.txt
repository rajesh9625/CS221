        My research is in computational vision, in particular how to integrate
        mechanisms for visual
        recognition and perceptual organization.
        I'm interested in how measuring the predictive power of different visual
        cues can provide general information-theoretic constraints on human
        visual processing.  I also work on developing tools for 
        biological image and shape analysis in order to
        measure morphology and spatial patterns of gene expression in
        developing animals.
