          « Close details
          Juliet is a grounded technologist. In the Spring of 2013, a wise man asked Juliet why she was so motivated to live sustainably. Sure, her exposure to the natural wonders of North America as a youth helped, but she realized it is her deep sense of responsibility for her actions upon the earth and to her kin. 
          It is because of this intrinsic interest in sustainability and wellbeing that she calls herself a grounded technologist.
          
          Juliet grew up in Florida and attended college at the University of Central Florida where she received a B.A. in Digital Media and later a M.S. in Computer Science. In her spare time she was found in the Arboretum on campus gardening, until one day she decided to make that her research. Around that time Juliet integrated into the Central Florida permaculture community and transformed her lifestyle in a soul satisfying way. Not only was she able to satisfy her desire to live sustainably, but she was a part of a collective of people who inspired her to reach out and "give back" to the world with the knowledge she had gained.
          
          Today Juliet lives in Irvine and attends the University of California in effort to address critical issues that affect the long term wellbeing of earth and humanity. As a student of Bill Tomlinson, a member of the GreenIT lab, and a participant in the on-campus Sustainability Initiative, Juliet is surrounded by inspiring and supportive people to help her achive her goal of making the world a happier, healthier place to live now and for future generations.
