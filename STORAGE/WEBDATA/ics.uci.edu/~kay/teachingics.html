Teaching in ICSStudents Teaching Computer Science 

in ICS at UCI


Students have a variety of opportunities to
help other students learn computer science at UCI:

  Graduate students may be awarded TAships; contact
your advisor or the ICS Graduate Office (Kris Bolcer
or Karina Bocanegra).

  Undergraduate students  help students as lab tutors for some first-year courses (more information). Undergraduates occasionally work as graders; contact the departmental office (Computer Science, Informatics, or Statistics). 

  Graduate students may be hired as TAs on a
quarterly basis; contact your departmental office. In certain cases, advanced
undergraduates may also be hired as TAs.

  Students may also gain teaching experience
by working as a tutor at the Learning and Academic Resources Center
(LARC)


TAs whose native language isn't English
can use these strategies for effective communication
in the classroom.
Instructors who think electronic mail makes their life harder might enjoy these tips for responding to student e-mail.

Lab tutors (current and prospective) should read ICS 31/32/33 Lab Tutor Guide. For a detailed view of the duties of a TA or
section leader in a lower-division class, consult the ICS 31/32/33 Guide.
(Many of the details vary from one course to another.)

For a detailed list of logistical details a
TA or reader should work out with a course instructor early in the quarter,
see What to Ask the Instructor.

The UCI Teaching, Learning & Technology Center
(TLTC) provides a wide variety of services relating to teaching.

UCI's Electronic Educational Environment
(EEE) at e3.uci.edu provides course rosters, course mailing lists, electronic
grade distribution, web-based course evaluations, and other services.
