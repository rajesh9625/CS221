Course goals and learning outcomes:  This course is exclusively for participants in the 2015–16 UTeach program. [Applications for the 2016–17 program will be available in Spring 2016 at the UTeach Program site.] We will cover course organization, presentation techniques and skills, classroom management, motivating students, giving and receiving feedback, and other aspects of college teaching.

  Meeting place and times:  Class meets
Tuesdays from 5:00 to 6:20 in Donald Bren Hall 1420 (but not both days every week).

Office hours:  We're happy to hear from UTeachers any time. Drop by, send a message, arrange a specific time if you like. You can also get pretty apid feedback from your colleagues and instructors  by posting on Piazza.com.
We will never intentionally ignore a message, so if you don't receive a response, write again; sometimes overactive spam filters snag a legitmate message. 

We will also send course announcements by Email
to the official course mailing list, so you should check your Email regularly.
 Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar
has for you (your UCInet ID).  If you prefer to read your electronic mail on an account other than your
UCInet account (which is a good idea, since if your UCInet account's mailbox fills up, you stop receiving mail), redirect your mail at http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html .

  Course structure:
This course is graded P/NP. Passing requires professionanl performance in (a) attendance and participation [Most of your learning will come from class discussions, presentations, activities, and feedback. We expect you to attend and participate actively in every class meeting except for schedule conflicts we know about and real emergencies], (b) scheduled presentations [Deliver each of your three presentations—5-minute, 10-minute, and 30-minute—well prepared on the scheduled date], and (c) written materials [Submit your final syllabus and detailed course plan according to the course schedule. Both documents must address previous comments of reviewers and demonstrate your readiness to teach your course.].
Special needs: Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation due to a disability should contact the UCI Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to explore the possible range of accommodations. We encourage all students having difficulty, whether or not due to a disability, to consult privately with the instructor at any time.

Approximate course schedule: Dates that are empty, we won't meet.
