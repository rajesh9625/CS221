                Projects
                Currently, I’m working on applying probabilistic learning techniques to improve automatic tuning and boundary detection  of lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) scintillation crystal arrays in the High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) brain PET scanner.  Manufacturer supplied tuning software performs poorly in situations where there is low signal-to-noise characteristics or when there is significant “cross-talk” from neighboring scintillators in the array.
                 
                Other Interests
                I am interested in applying AI and machine learning techniques to medical imaging data, modeling brain circuitry (both nuclei and interconnections between nuclei) abnormalities in a variety of neurological disorders.  Further interests include biomedical informatic methods for enabling large-scale distributed data federations.  For the past 6 years I’ve been working on tools to enable the documentation and  federation of distributed fMRI data across multi-site collaboratories.
