The Hadoop control scripts (but not the daemons) rely on SSH
    to perform cluster-wide operations. For example, there is a script for
    stopping and starting all the daemons in the cluster. Note that the
    control scripts are optional—cluster-wide operations can be performed by
    other mechanisms, too (such as a distributed shell).
To work seamlessly, SSH needs to be set up to allow password-less
    login for the hadoop user from machines
    in the cluster. The simplest way to achieve this is to generate a
    public/private key pair and place it in an NFS location that is shared
    across the cluster.
First, generate an RSA key pair by typing the following in the
    hadoop user account:
% ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Even though we want password-less logins, keys without passphrases
    are not considered good practice (it’s OK to have an empty passphrase when
    running a local pseudo-distributed cluster, as described in Appendix A), so we specify a passphrase when prompted for one. We
    use ssh-agent to avoid the need to
    enter a password for each connection.
The private key is in the file specified by the -f option, ~/.ssh/id_rsa, and the public key is stored in
    a file with the same name but with .pub appended, ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
Next we need to make sure that the public key is in the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on all the machines
    in the cluster that we want to connect to. If the hadoop user’s home directory is an NFS
    filesystem, as described earlier, the keys can be shared across the
    cluster by typing:
% cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
If the home directory is not shared using NFS, the public keys will
    need to be shared by some other means (such as ssh-copy-id).
Test that you can SSH from the master to a worker machine by making
    sure ssh-agent is running,[77] and then run ssh-add to
    store your passphrase. You should be able to ssh to a worker without entering the passphrase
    again.
