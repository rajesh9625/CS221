 Education
 I graduated from the Texas Academy of Math and Science
 (high school) in 1994, and attended college at Caltech.
 I lived in Blacker House, majored in mathematics and 
 electrical engineering, and graduated in 1998. I then attended graduate
 school at MIT in the Stochastic Systems Group
 where I completed my PhD in 2005 under the supervision of Alan Willsky and
 John Fisher.




 
 Karate
 I'm a member of SKA since 1994, and have at various times
 called home dojos in Denton, TX; 
 Caltech;
 MIT; 
 Lake Forest, CA; and
 Chicago, IL.
 Photos from the SKA 2001 trip to Japan and the Waseda University karate club's
 70th anniversary can be found here.
