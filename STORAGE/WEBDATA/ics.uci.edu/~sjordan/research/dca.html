                 Dynamic Channel Allocation in Cellular Networks                  
      Our focus in this work is dynamic channel allocation in cellular networks.  Many DCA algorithms have been proposed in the literature. However, they are often based on heuristics, and optimal policies are rarely considered. Our goal here is to present a framework within which DCA policies can be presented and evaluated.
            
      In the first paper,
      we suggest a categorization of DCA   policies on the basis how the policy determines connection access control, channel assignment, and channel reassignment. We hope that this categorization will help distill the concepts   involved and encourage the research that is necessary to extend these concepts   to future integrated service wireless systems.

      In the second paper,       
      we suggest that the optimal DCA policy varies from maximum packing at low loads to fixed allocation at high loads. This   policy is often impractical to implement, but can be considered as a performance   bound on practical systems.

      In the third paper, we introduce two worst-base performance metrics. We prove a lower bound on any DCA policy, and demonstrate the tradeoff between the performance and the complexity of a channel   allocation policy.

      In the final paper, we consider DCA in interference-limited systems such as CDMA. We focus on the relationship   between system performance and the amount of imbalance in load among neighboring   cells. We find that with use of C/I information, the   difference in performance between FCA and DCA (in terms of throughput or   blocking probability) is increasing with load imbalance.
