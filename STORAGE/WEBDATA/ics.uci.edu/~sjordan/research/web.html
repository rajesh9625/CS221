                 Web Server Performance under User Impatience                   Web users are notoriously impatient, willing to wait only a few seconds 
      before aborting a pending web request. This behavior unnecessarily taxes web 
      server resources, which are dedicated to a connection that ultimately does not 
      complete. While this is not as problematic at well-provisioned or 
      lightly-trafficked web servers, where all incoming requests can be serviced with 
      little or no queuing time required, such behavior is extremely detrimental to 
      poorly-provisioned or very busy web servers, where server deadlock may occur and 
      no users are adequately served.
      In this work, we analytically derive, using queuing models, a service 
        ordering for web servers that is useful under these extreme conditions and that 
        takes into account the impatience of web users. The ordering is based on a 
        revenue generation model that assumes a web server earns some amount from 
        processing a user request to completion. This amount diminishes exponentially 
        with the time spent in queue and in service at the web server. In such cases, a 
        greedy algorithm maximizes server revenue and outperforms "fair" algorithms such 
        a first-in-first-out by several orders of magnitude when server load is high. 
        These performance gains continue even when the server passes into an overload 
        situation, allowing the web server to operate even when completely saturated. 
        These results are verified both analytically and via simulation, and have been 
        shown to be useful for general Markovian queuing systems as well.
