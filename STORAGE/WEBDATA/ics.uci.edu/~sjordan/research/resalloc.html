                 Connection Access Control in Multimedia Networks                  Our focus in this work is on connection access control in networks supporting multiple types of services. The approach taken is fundamental and generic.
       
      In the first set of papers, we consider connection-oriented services that require different amounts of network resources, e.g. integrated services in a circuit-switched or reservation-based network. We first characterize the combination of service loads that can be supported by a set of network resources, and the relationships between the load and resource requirements of each service class and the network revenue that can be obtained from these loads. We then characterize the connection access control policy that maximizes network revenue. Finally, we derive numerical techniques to increase the size of the networks for which optimal connection access control policies can be determined.

      The second set of papers considers applications that require sequential use of network resources. The results characterize the connection access control policy that maximizes network revenue.
