                 Information for Prospective Graduate Students                  Our research group does not currently have openings for students
      pursuing M.S. and Ph.D. degrees with a primary interest in computer networks. (In the future, when we do, applicants to our research group are expected to have an exceptional
        background and interest in applying probability and random process theory to
        computer network and telecommunications problems.)
      The CS Department and the Networked Systems programs are considering applicants. For best consideration, prospective graduate students
      should apply by Jan. 1.      
      At UCI, computer networks can be pursued as a research topic in four different programs:
      
         Networked Systems: The Networked Systems Program grants a M.S. and/or Ph.D. in Networked Systems. Students in the Networked Systems program typically take core courses in networks,  breadth   courses selected from technical courses (including distributed systems, algorithms, data structures, operating systems,   databases, random processes, and linear systems) and management and applications   of technology (including educational technology, management of information   technology, and social impact), and concentration courses selected   from a long list including courses on networks, performance, middleware,   communications, and operations research. Apply directly to the Networked Systems   Program.
        Computer Science: The Department of Computer Science grants a M.S. and/or Ph.D.   in Information and Computer Science with a Concentration   in Computer Science. Students in the Concentration in Computer Science typically take courses in networks,   algorithms, databases, and other computer science areas. Apply directly to the Department of Computer Science.  
        Electrical and Computer Engineering: The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science grants  a M.S. and/or Ph.D in Electrical   and Computer Engineering with either a Concentration   in Computers Networks & Distributed Systems (CNDC) or a Concentration   in Electrical Engineering (EE). Students in the concentration in CNDC typically take courses in networks, operating   systems, algorithms, distributed systems, and other computer engineering areas.   Students in the concentration in EE typically take courses   in networks, random processes, communications, signal processing, and other   electrical engineering areas. Apply directly to the Deparment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
          
      Our research group reviews applications for Networked Systems and for Computer Science, but not usually for Electrical and Computer Engineering.Scott Jordanlast modified June 9, 2015UCI
