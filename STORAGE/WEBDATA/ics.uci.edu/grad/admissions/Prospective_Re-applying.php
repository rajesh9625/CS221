Re-Applying to ICS




How to re-apply to an ICS gradute program
You will need to submit an online application and pay the application fee in order to re-apply to the program. If you are re-applying within a one-year period, you may re-use the original documents; however, we encourage you to update your file with a new statement of purpose and letters of recommendation. If you are re-applying after one year, you will need to re-submit all new documents. GRE and TOEFL scores must be current at the time of re-application. Please send an email to gcounsel@ics.uci.edu letting us know which documents you would like to re-use.
