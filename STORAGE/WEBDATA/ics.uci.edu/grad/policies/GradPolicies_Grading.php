Graduate Student Policies: Grading Standards




Grades are available from the Registrar’s Office (fees apply for copies
of official transcripts; unofficial transcripts are free of charge) or through
Student Access. It is the student’s responsibility to check grades at the end of
each quarter.
Traditional grades (A, B, C, etc…) 
Students are expected to maintain a B
average (this is an absolute requirement if on a fellowship—GSR, TA, GAANN,
etc.). In order to receive graduation credit, students must earn a grade of B
or better in all required courses, core courses and breadth courses. A grade of
B- or below does not have to be improved and can remain on the transcript if
that grade is not going to be counted toward graduation requirements.
Pass/No Pass
P/NP is for undergraduate students only. Graduate students
must receive a letter grade to pass a course. Graduate students should not sign
up for a course P/NP.
Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory
S/U is for graduate courses only and is
considered to be a letter grade. Faculty can assign an S/U instead of an A, B,
C, etc. Students are responsible for asking the instructor if they can receive
the S/U option instead of an A, B, C, etc. at the beginning of the quarter.
Please keep in mind that the S grade is equal to a B or better and the U grade
is equal to a B- or below. A student who receives a U grade will have to repeat
the course if it is going to count towards degree requirements.
Incomplete 
The “I” grade is reserved for occasions when a student’s
work is satisfactory but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the
student’s control, and when the student has been excused in advance from
completing the quarter’s work. Students may ask the instructor to assign an
“I,” but it may or may not be granted. If granted, a student has up to three
quarters to complete the work. If the work is not completed and a grade has not
been assigned after three quarters, the “I” will turn to an F. Once the work
has been completed, the instructor must turn in a grade change report to change
the “I” into a letter grade. The student should check Student Access often to
confirm that the grade has been changed.
Graduate Division will not continue to approve employment for a student
who has more than two Incompletes on their transcript.
No Report 
NR means no grade was reported. This can be the result of a
variety of reasons:

The faculty member did not turn the grades in on timeThe faculty member does not recognize the student’s name on the class
rosterThe faculty member turned in the wrong gradeThe course’s grade roster was unreadable


An NR will turn into an F after one quarter. Students who receive an NR
should talk to their instructor immediately. The professor will need to
complete a grade change report.
