For Prospective Graduate Students

 How long does it take for a decision to be reached on my application?

Decisions are ongoing, therefore, you may hear as early as March or as late as May/June. 
			  
			  You will be notified of the final decision via email and the online Tracker. We cannot provide you with the final decision over the phone.


 When will I be notified of my funding offer?

If funding has been awarded, notification will be included with your admissions offer.


 How will I know if my file is missing any documents or whether my file is complete?

Applicants may login to the online Tracker to check for application materials received.  


 Do I need to take the GRE General Exam?

Yes, the general GRE exam is required of all applicants. GRE scores are good for five years, after which time the exam must be repeated. We cannot accept GMA scores in lieu of GRE scores.
			  
			  Only the General exam is required; we do not require the subject GRE exam, although it is recommended for applicants without a background in Computer Science or a related area.  


 If my undergraduate degree is not in the same area as the graduate degree in which I am interested, can I still apply?

Yes, but it is helpful if you have taken courses in computer science and math, and/or have some related work experience.


 Do I have to submit online letters of recommendation?

You may elect to submit online or hard copy letters of recommendation.


 May I submit more than three letters of recommendation?

You may submit as many recommendation letters as you wish.


 Can I attend part time or take evening classes?

M.S. students may petition to attend part time, but Ph.D. students are required to attend full time. 
			  
			  The Bren School does not offer evening or weekend classes at this time; all classes are offered during the day.


 Can I be waived out of the TOEFL requirement?

UCI will only waive the TOEFL requirement for applicants who have completed ALL requirements for a B.S., M.S. or Ph.D. degree in the U.S. prior to submitting their application. 


 Can the application fee be waived or deferred?

Only official transcripts are acceptable in order to complete your application. Use institutional code 4859 to have official GRE and TOEFL scores sent from the testing agency to UCI.


 Do I need to send bank certification or financial verification at the time of application?

No. Once admitted, all international students who accept the admission offer are required to submit a financial questionnaire and financial verification documents.


 If I am re-applying to the program, do I need to re-submit all my documents?

You will need to submit an online application and pay the application fee in order to re-apply to the program. 
			  
If you are re-applying within a one-year period, you may re-use the original documents; however, we encourage you to update your file with a new statement of purpose and letters of recommendation.

GRE and TOEFL scores must be current at the time of re-application. 
			  Please send an email to gcounsel@ics.uci.edu letting us know which documents you would like to re-use.
			  
			  If you are re-applying after one year, you will need to re-submit all new documents. 


 Do you admit for the Winter or Spring quarter?

No. The Bren School only admits for the Fall quarter.


 Who do I contact if I’m having trouble with the online application?
