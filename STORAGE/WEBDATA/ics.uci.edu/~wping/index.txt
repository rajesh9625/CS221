    About me
    
        
        
            
                I am a PhD student (5th year) in department of computer science at UC Irvine, working with Prof. Alexander Ihler. Before that, I received my B.S. in computer science from Harbin Institute of Technology, and M.E. in software engineering from Tsinghua University.

    Research interests
    
        
            I am broadly interested in machine learning and data mining. Currently, I am focusing on statistical learning and inference in probabilistic graphical models.
