v 
6Feb2016:
Thanks to the good efforts of Minhaeng Lee, the
Reader, we have updated the Quiz #2 key to include the approximate percentage
and number of students who scored Perfect, Partial, and Zero on each question
(available here
and in the Study Guides section below).

v 
3Feb2016:
Thanks to the good efforts of Minhaeng Lee, the
Reader, we have released a revised Testing Shell v.0.2 (available here, and also
in the Project section below). This testing shell
should accommodate your Sudoku solver.

            Minhaeng 's fervent hope is that you will
discover all of the problems with the testing shell quickly, and report them to
him promptly, so that he may fix them and improve your experience.   Please send feedback email to
minhaenl@uci.edu, and CC me when you do so.

            Because
we did not provide the promised testing shell for your code prior to the due
date, and since many of your programs had problems, the CS-171 Teaching Staff
after discussion has decided to treat this assignment very gently and
charitably.  Provided that you
turned in something that was binary, source, and documentation, you will not be
penalized if your code did not work in our scripts,
because it is partially our fault since you were not provided with the promised
testing shell. 

            ****  You are
responsible for fixing your code so that on the *next* assignment it runs
correctly in our scripts (= it runs correctly in the current released Testing
Shell).  Otherwise, you will lose
points on the *next* assignment.

v 
3Feb2016:
The answer key to Quiz #2 has been posted below and also is available
here.

v 
28Jan2016:
Thanks to the good efforts of Minhaeng Lee, the
Reader, a test shell to validate your programs on openlab
is available here.
This shell is only for testing whether student's program is runnable on the openlab environment. Note that, currently, the testing
shell doesn't contain tests for whether or not the output is correct. We will
update later.

v 
28Jan2016:
Thanks to the good efforts of Junkyu Lee, the TA, a
detailed description of exactly what to turn in for your Sudoku Project Assignments
is available here.  It will be updated as we go along. Please
note that we are still discussing what to do about the Generator portion of the
project, which was canceled (see below) because the provided Java shell
included a generator. However, apparently some students have written their own
generator anyway. Most likely we will give extra credit for extra work; but the
matter is still under discussion. In the meantime, it is OK if your program
accepts the GEN and BT option tokens, even if they do not appear in the current
description.

v 
28Jan2016:
A former CS-171 student has shared some news that you may find of interest.

"...
a few hours ago, Google announced that one of their
DeepMind AI's, AlphaGo, was able to successfully
defeat a Go master in a game without any handicap."

v 
Every
project team, including
students who code in Java, must turn in the Backtracking Search
assignment by Sunday, 31 Jan. Erroneously, an
announcement below (now canceled) previously said that “For students who
code in Java, *nothing* will be due on Sun., 31 Jan.” We later realized
that even students who code in Java must submit code and executables that
function correctly under our project scripts.

v 
In
order to make the Project more fair to students who code in Python or C++, the
CS-171 Teaching Staff has decided to offer Extra Credit points to any student
who writes their own project shell without using or copying code from the Java
shell provided (it is OK to look at it for ideas, but not to copy it directly).
In order to be fair, this offer is available to all students, including those
who prefer to code in Java. The exact amount of Extra Credit will be decided
and posted to EEE GradeBook shortly.

v 
EEE
DropBoxes for your project assignments are now
available. Please follow the file format and naming conventions stated below.

v 
The
Syllabus part of the class website has been reorganized to be more
user-friendly and easier to navigate. For each week, material has been grouped
and ordered as: Lecture Slides, Discussion Slides, Project Deadlines, Optional
Homework, Optional Reading, and Optional Cultural Interest.

v 
The
quiz #1 key has been posted below and is available here.

v 
A
description of what to turn in for your first assignment is available here.
It currently covers Backtracking Search (due Sun., 31 Jan., 11:59pm), and will
be expanded as we go along.

v 
Sun., 24 Jan., 11:59pm: DEADLINE CANCELLED --- SEE CLASS EMAIL.  *NOTHING* IS DUE THIS SUN., 24 JAN. 
Project Problem Generator Deadline.
You will lose 10% of your Project grade for every day it is late, pro-rated for
fractional days and rounded up to the nearest integer percentage point above.

v 
I
have revised the class website to cancel the Sun., Jan. 24, deadline.  The Java coding shell that was provided
has rendered the generator unnecessary, even for students who prefer C++ or
Python.

            I
am and remain embarrassed that there is a Java shell but no C++ nor Python shell (which are expected to be written this
quarter by former CS-171 students who scored A- or better).

            Nevertheless,
upon discussion, the CS-171 Teaching Staff (the TA, Reader, and I) became
worried about the possibly excessive workload if we made you code *everything*
from scratch with no guidance whatsoever.

            In
the end, our worries about a possibly excessive workload outweighed our
concerns that releasing a Java-only coding shell would favor students who
preferred Java.  It became yet
another engineering trade-off, and concerns about excessive workload became
more important.

            For
students who prefer C++ or Python, please recognize that your task has been
greatly simplified by the release of the Java shell. Even if you do not prefer
Java, surely you can read it, and porting/translating existing code is always
easier than writing it from scratch.

            ****  For students
who code in C++ or Python, I apologize that your ported/translated backtracking
search working code still will be due on 
Sun., 31 Jan., 11:59pm.  The
reason is so that you do not fall behind in your coding project.  Your submitted code should be
essentially a port/translation of the provided Java backtracking search shell.  I apologize that I have only a Java
shell now; but it is what I have do now, and porting/translating it will move
you greatly forward relative to the workload of coding it from scratch.

            For
students who code in Java, *nothing* will be due on Sun., 31 Jan., 11:59pm,
because the shell provides it all. 
Please do not rest on your laurels. 
Instead, please use this time to get further ahead in your project.

            All
remaining Project deadlines will persist unchanged.  The TA and the Reader (Junkyu Lee and Minhaeng Lee) are
in charge of the Project, and shortly will release relative weights of the
several Project components.

v 
The
CS-171 Teaching Staff discussed the Project and decided to release a Java coding
shell for Sudoku. I do not yet have C++ or Python shells (they will be written
this quarter), and it has never been tested by “live” use in a
CS-171 class. In spite of these limitations, we thought it might be helpful to
you as an example.

v 
The
CS-171 Teaching Staff discussed Project grading and decided to temper justice
with mercy. You will lose 10% of your Project grade for every day it is late,
pro-rated for fractional days and rounded up to the nearest integer percentage
point above. (Previously, you lost 10% for every day or fraction thereof that
it was late.)

v

Goal:

The goal of this class is to familiarize you with the basic
principles of artificial intelligence. You will learn some
basic AI techniques, the problems for which they are applicable, and
their limitations.

The
course content is organized roughly around what are often considered to be
three central pillars of AI: Search, Logic, and Learning. Topics covered
include basic search, heuristic search, game search, constraint satisfaction,
knowledge representation, logic and inference, probabilistic modeling, and
machine learning algorithms. 







Class Setup:

The
course will be primarily lecture-based. 
There will be a Mid-term and a Final Exam.  On most second Tuesdays, adjusting for
the the Mid-term Exam, the first 20 minutes will be
an in-class pop quiz, followed by lecture (see specific dates in Important Dates above).  The frequent quizzes are intended to encourage
you to stay current with the course material.  All exams and quizzes may cover all
material presented in class, including lectures and assigned textbook reading.  Quizzes will cover mostly material
presented since the last quiz, and also may include questions that many
students missed on the previous quiz. 
The Final Exam will cover mostly material since the Mid-term Exam, and
also will include many questions intended to encourage you to remember the earlier
material (i.e., it will be comprehensive). Please study the previous
CS-171 quizzes and exams (below), which are
made available as study guides to help you learn and master the class material;
they are important guides about the performance that will be expected from you
now.

There
will be an AI coding project (see Project section
below).  You are allowed to do the
project by yourself, or you may form project teams of two students following
the “Pair
Programming” paradigm. 
Please note that you are encouraged to discuss concepts, methods,
algorithms, etc.; but you are forbidden to copy: (1) source code from any
source, or (2) text from any source unless properly cited and set off as a
quote.  Except for class materials
provided from this class website, you must invent and write all of your own
code by yourself with your partner. 
Except for properly referenced material, you must write all of your own
project report by yourself with your partner. Please note that your source code and project report are
subject to analysis by automated plagiarism detection programs, and that direct
copying will be treated as an act of academic dishonesty (please see the
section on “Academic Honesty”
below). Please start your AI coding project earlier than you believe necessary;
it will take longer and be more difficult than you expect (as is true of all
coding projects everywhere at all times).

All
my AI project shells were written by former CS-171 students who became
interested in AI and signed up for CS-199 in order to pursue their interest and
write more interesting AI project shells. 
Please let me know if this is of interest to you (CS-171 grade of A- or
better required).

Homework
will be assigned, but is not graded. The reason is that prior student course
evaluations alerted me to the existence of student cheating by way of copying
the homework answers.  I deplore
this degree of personal degradation in dishonest students, but I cannot control
it, and so I avoid the opportunity. 
I remain determined to create a fair and honest educational experience
for all students, as best I can.







Textbook

Required:  Russell & Norvig : Artificial
Intelligence; A Modern Approach, 3rd edition.

The
course is based on, and the UCI bookstore has, the 3rd edition. The assigned
textbook reading is required, and is fair game for quizzes and exams.  You
place yourself at a distinct disadvantage if you do not have the textbook.  I expect that you have a personal copy
of the textbook, and quizzes and exams are written accordingly.

Please
purchase or rent your own personal textbook for the quarter (and then resell it
back to the UCI Bookstore at the end if you don't want it for reference).
Please do not
jeopardize your precious educational experience with the false economy of trying
to save a few dollars by not having a personal copy of the textbook.

Also,
for your convenience, I have requested that a copy of the textbook be placed on
reserve in the UCI Science Library. There is a two-hour check-out limit. However,
please understand that with high student enrollments, it is unrealistic to
expect that these thin reserves always will be available when you need
them.  Please
purchase or rent your own personal textbook.

I do deplore the high cost of textbooks.  You are likely to find the book cheaper
if you search online at EBay.com, Amazon.com, and related sites.

A
helpful student kindly contributed this link to a blog that offers a PDF of the
course textbook, for which I cannot vouch:

            http://crazy-readers.blogspot.com/2013/08/artificial-intelligence-modern-approach.html

 

Another
helpful student kindly contributed this link, which also offers a PDF of the
course textbook, again for which I cannot vouch:

            https://www.dropbox.com/s/gq9gatmroagrsf2/Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach%20%283rd%20Edition%29.pdf?dl=0

 

You
can also try to search the Internet for “artificial intelligence a modern
approach pdf 3rd edition”. Several more hits turned up the last time I
did so.

 

A
helpful student kindly contributed the following suggestion, for which I cannot
vouch:

Hello, 
I just wanted to point out that there does exist an
international edition of the book which can be bought for around $40-50. I
cannot comment on what specific differences there are for this particular book,
though they are usually very small (exercises moved around, etc).
Obviously, it is in paperback.

            http://www.biblio.com/books/360025589.html

Personally I plan on using this book for a while so I bought the hardcover
version, but I just wanted to point out that this is an option for those
looking for a more 'economical' route.

Grading:

Your grade will be based on the
bi-weekly quizzes (20%), a project (20%),
a mid-term exam (25%), and a final exam (35%). Homework is assigned but
ungraded.

 

·       
Quizzes will be given
the first 20 minutes of class on the dates listed in Important Dates above, and are
closed-book, closed-notes.  Your
lowest quiz score will be discarded in computing your grade.  It is not possible to make-up missed
quizzes, but one missed quiz may be discarded as your lowest quiz score.

·       
The mid-term exam
will be given in class on Thursday, Feb. 11, and is closed-book,
closed-notes.  It is not possible
to make-up a missed mid-term exam.

·       
The final exam will
be given on Friday, Mar. 18, 10:30am-12:30pm, and is closed-book,
closed-notes.  The final exam will
cover all course material from the entire quarter, with emphasis on the second
half.  It is not possible to
make-up a missed final exam.

            *
Dates and times for all final exams are set by the UCI Registrar (Final Exam
Schedule 2015-16)

 

I make exceptions for:

            *
genuine medical conditions (I require a signed note
from your doctor on official letterhead),

            *
births/deaths in the family (I require a copy of
the birth/death certificate),

            *
jury duty or other court proceedings (I require a
copy of your jury service papers or other official court documents), or

            *
field maneuvers of the US military or National Guard (I require a copy of
your official orders).

Also, I honor all requests made by the UCI Disability Services Center.

 

·       
The AI coding project will be a “Monster Sudoku”
solver.  “Monster
Sudoku” is played on a board larger than 9x9 and is harder than
regulation Sodoku.  Previously, when I gave students a
coding project of regulation 9x9 Sudoku, they complained that it was too
easy.  So, we have made it harder.

 

·       
Every student who fills out a course evaluation
for CS-171 will receive a bonus of 1% added to their final grade, free and
clear, off the curve, simply a bonus.

        EEE will
return to me the names of students who fill out evaluations (but not the
content, which remains anonymous), provided that enough students fill out
evaluations so that anonymity is not compromised.  I will add 1% free bonus to the final
grade of each such named student.

        Student
course evaluations are very important to me for monitoring and improving the
course content, and very important to UCI for evaluating our success at our
educational mission.  *Please* fill
out your student course evaluations.

 

·       
“Bonus Points” will be awarded, at my sole
discretion, (1) to the first student who spots a genuine technical error (typos
don’t count) in any of the course materials before I spot it too, and (2)
for helpful contributions to the class as we go along.  One bonus point is equivalent to one
quiz point.

 

            Your
Bonus Points, if any, should be visible to you in EEE GradeBook.
If for some reason you have been awarded a Bonus Point, but you did not get a
notification from me or it did not appear in EEE GradeBook,
please do not hesitate to send an email message to me as a reminder.

 







Study Habits:

 

This course is technical, rigorous, and
demanding. You will be expected to learn and master a large body of technical
material in a very short period of time. You must demonstrate your mastery by
(1) accurate performance on frequent quizzes and exams, and (2) successful
implementation of an AI coding project.

I
deliberately treat you as adults who are responsible for your own educational
decisions, and so Lecture and Discussion Sections are optional. Nevertheless,
students who do not attend both Lecture and Discussion Sections are at a serious
disadvantage and do not succeed as well in this class.  Students who spend Lectures and
Discussion Sections sleeping, on cell phones, surfing the Web, or on social
media are wasting their time and might as well be absent.  Such students send me email messages to
ask questions that already were covered thoroughly and in detail during Lecture
and again in Discussion Section.  On
quizzes and exams, they miss points that already have been covered thoroughly.

Your
educational moments are precious, and your education now will be the single
most important factor in your future career success or failure.  Please, make the most of your precious
educational moments now. Please, attend both Lecture and Discussion Section, pay
attention, ask questions, and master the material.

Please
do not ever fall behind in the class material; instead, study frequently and
diligently. Please begin your AI coding project earlier than you believe
necessary; it will take longer and be more difficult than you expect (as is
true of all coding projects everywhere at all times).

Please
work harder and study longer. 
Please understand thoroughly all class material, and ask questions when
you do not understand.  Please
attend all lectures and discussion sections.  Please come to lectures and discussion
sections prepared with questions about any material that is not clear.  Please do all assigned reading, both
before and again after lecture. Please review the lecture notes, several times
over, both before and again after lecture, until you understand every detail.
Please regularly attend office hours with me and the TA. Please ask questions
about any class material that is not absolutely crystal clear.

Please
work and understand all past quizzes and exams; they are important guides
about the performance that will be expected from you now. Please work and
understand all the optional homework.

Please
OVERSTUDY!!















































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































Syllabus:

after, the human era will be ended. 
Is such progress avoidable? If not to be avoided, can events be guided
so that we may survive?  These
questions are investigated. Some possible answers (and some further dangers)
are presented.”

            Eric
comments, “One thing to possibly discuss with the last slide is that the
itinerary it settles on does stay at a higher energy for a little bit until it
passes closest to Europa, maximizing the velocity before the insertion sequence
to the lower energy.  This is indeed
optimal behavior, as opposed to immediately reducing its energy as a Greedy
Best First algorithm using this heuristic would want to do.”

            “Boxcar 2D”

                                    The
program learns to build a car using a genetic algorithm. 

                                    If
you let this program run for a long time (>> 30 generations), you will see
that eventually it produces cars well suited to the terrain. This outcome
illustrates a general theme of genetic algorithms: very, very slow; but,
eventually, good performance. After all, it took ~3.6 billion years to evolve
humans from bacteria (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_evolutionary_history_of_life).
Please note that this eventual good performance of genetic algorithms is
conditional upon a representation that allows good solutions to sub-problems to
be combined simply, by cross-over, into a globally good solution; if the vector
position of the features is completely randomized within the chromosome, any
such good performance is lost.

Project:

(1) A Java coding shell for Sudoku is available in case it may be helpful
to you as an example (shell, specification).
I do not yet have C++ or Python shells (they will be written this quarter), and
it has never been tested by “live” use in a CS-171 class. In spite
of these limitations, we thought it might be helpful to you as an example.

(2) (revised 3 Feb 2016) Thanks to the good
efforts of Minhaeng Lee, the Reader, a test shell to
validate your programs on openlab.ics.uci.edu is available here. This
shell is only for testing whether student's program is runnable on the openlab environment. Please note that, currently, the
testing shell doesn't contain tests for whether or not the output is correct.
We will update it later.

(3) Thanks to the good efforts of Junkyu Lee,
the TA, a detailed description of exactly what to turn in for your Sudoku
Project Assignments is available here.  It will be updated as we go along. Please
note that we are still discussing what to do about the Generator portion of the
project, which was canceled because the provided Java shell included a
generator. However, apparently some students have written their own generator
anyway. Most likely we will give extra credit for extra work; but the matter is
still under discussion. In the meantime, it is OK if your program accepts the
GEN and BT option tokens. If you wrote your own generator then exactly one
of the GEN and BT tokens must be present (one is required but they are mutually
exclusive), and they govern whether your program is being run in generate (GEN)
or solver (BT) mode. If you did not write your own generator then you may
ignore, but must tolerate, both the GEN and BT tokens. Please see the Sudoku
Project Assignments document described in this paragraph for more details.

(4) A slideshow
about the Monster Sudoku coding project is available here.  

(5) A Specification for your Monster Sudoku problem Reader and Generator
is available here.
It is largely superseded because the provided Java shell already contains a
Generator.

(6) Just for fun, once upon a time I wrote LISP code (available here) that
computes the "odometer" style tokens up to any arbitrarily large N
(example of the resulting tokens available here).  Please note that this
"odometer" material is purely for cultural interest, i.e., you will
never be responsible for "odometer" style tokens above 35 on quizzes,
exams, or the project. 
Nevertheless, it is a curious wrinkle that is interesting to see,
especially if you are interested in bigger and better.

 

 

Please note:
The C++ target platform should be x86. You should write your code to run on any
x86 machine. The OS is CentOS 6. We most likely will
need to compile your code with CentOS 6 (RHEL 6) x86_64. Machines in the openlab.ics.uci.edu
(family-guy.ics.uci.edu) are CentOS 6. Your code should run on openlab.ics.uci.edu.

 

 

 

Project Deadlines:

·       
Project
deadlines are given above in the Important Dates
section.

 

·       
Your EEE DropBox submission must be a single “zipped”
file named “yourLastName_yourUCINumericID_yourTeamName.”  NO SPACES in yourTeamName.

·       
It should have three
subdirectories: src, bin, & doc; for source,
executable, and documents (‘doc’
must contain your Project Report).

·       
Please deposit only one
submission per team.

·       
If your partner has
deposited your submission, please deposit a text file stating your name/ID,
your partner’s name/ID, and your team name. Please use the same filename
format given above.

 

·       
You
will lose 10% of your project score for each day (or part thereof) that your
project is late for any deadline. Please submit your project early, well ahead
of the deadline, and avoid the last-minute rush. If system problems, web congestion,
or other unavoidable Internet delays make your project late, it is still late
and will be penalized.

 



















































































































































































































































 

































































































































































































 



















































Study Guides --- Previous CS-171 Quizzes,
Mid-term, and Final exams:

Previous
CS-171 Quizzes, Mid-term exams, and Final exams are available here as study
guides.

 

As an
incentive to study this material, at least one question from a previous Quiz or
Exam will appear on every new Quiz or Exam. In particular, questions that many
students missed are likely to appear again. If you missed a question, please
study it carefully and learn from your mistake --- so that if it appears again,
you will understand it perfectly.

 

Please note
that some of the very old tests below reflect different textbooks that may
define some things differently than does your current textbook. In case of conflict,
your current textbook is deemed correct and will prevail. Some of your
visualization systems may not display the red PDF overlays used to correct
errors in very old tests. For example, in problems #2a, #2c, #3a, and #3b on
Quiz #2 from SQ’2004, the PDF overlay is invisible on a Mac (iPad), and
possibly on some other systems or printers.  The PDF overlays just do not seem to
work as advertised (sorry!!), but this problem seems only to afflict very old
tests (i.e., from over a decade ago). If you are confused by any of the answers
below, please bring your questions to the TA in Discussion Section.  If you find a genuine error anywhere,
please send me email and you will receive a Bonus Point if correct.

 

Also, a
student has recommended ‘quizlet.com’ as a good online study
resource. While I cannot vouch for it, apparently it contains several good
study aids for your textbook.

Academic Honesty: 

Academic dishonesty is unacceptable
and will not be tolerated at the University of California, Irvine. It is the
responsibility of each student to be familiar with UCI's current academic
honesty policies. Please take the time to read the current UCI
Academic Senate Policy On Academic Integrity and
the ICS
School Policy on Academic Honesty.

The
policies in these documents will be adhered to scrupulously. Any student who
engages in cheating, forgery, dishonest conduct, plagiarism, or collusion in dishonest
activities, will receive an academic evaluation of ``F'' for the entire course,
with a letter of explanation to the student's permanent file. The ICS Student Affairs Office
will be involved at every step of the process. Dr. Lathrop seeks to create a
level playing field for all students.
