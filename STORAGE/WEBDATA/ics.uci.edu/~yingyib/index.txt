 I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of California, Irvine, advised by Prof. Michael J. Carey. Before that, I got a B.Sc. from 
Nanjing University, China, an M.Phil. from
The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and also 
fulltimely worked in Microsoft SQL
Server group .

 Research Interests 
My primary area of research interest is in building and evaluating Big Data management systems. 

	Current projects:

Pregelix. Pregelix is an open-source implementation of Google's Pregel programming model. We
	architect the Pregel programming model on top of a general-purpose data-parallel  
	execution engine, which leads to better scaling properties, out-of-core support, physical flexibility, and software simplicity.
AsterixDB. We are working towards an open source data-intensive computing platform, with new technologies for ingesting,
storing, managing, indexing, querying, analyzing, and subscribing intensive semi-structured data. 

	Past projects:
	HaLoop. In HaLoop, we designed and implemented a modified version of 
the Hadoop MapReduce framework for efficiently support data-intensive iterative data analysis.
