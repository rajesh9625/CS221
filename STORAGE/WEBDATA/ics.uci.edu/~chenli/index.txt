Research

My research interests are in the fields of databases and information
retrieval, including search, data-intensive computing,
data integration and sharing, data warehouses, data cleansing,
and Web information management.  The following are several database
projects I am working on. 

Current Projects
 ASTERIX: This project is about
Active, Scalable, Transactional Enterprise Repository for Information in XML. It's a new effort to develop a scalable semi-structured information management system, based on XML and XQuery technologies, targeting very large shared-nothing compute clusters.

  

Past Projects
FLAMINGO: A project on data cleaning. 

IPUBMED: Efficient instant
  search on large amounts of data.  It started with the joint
  research project
  with Tsinghua University on
  efficient auto-complete and type-ahead search on large data sets.

Family Reunification.
Help people find their loved ones during or after a disaster.
The Raccoon Project on Data
Integration and Sharing.  I started this project several years ago,
and it's in its final stage. I still have some ongoing research related to
this project. But compared to the first two projects, this one is less active.
 Data sets of the history 
of data objects collected from 6 web sites in 1.5 years..
