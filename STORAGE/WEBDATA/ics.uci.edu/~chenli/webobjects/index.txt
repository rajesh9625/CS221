Overview

Many applications need to retrieve information about objects
from remote Web sources that are autonomous and non-collaborative.  An example is a service provider (e.g.,
Monster.com) that is specific to a certain application domain such as jobs. For
such applications, it is critical to understand how the objects at the remote
sources change over time. Such information can help the application decide a
good crawling schedule in order to maintain a high quality of its data while it
does not overuse network resources. 

 

In order to gain an insight on how data objects on the Web
change over time, we have collected data objects from six Web sources in four
domains, including books, cars, forums, and jobs. Our crawlers collected
data objects from these sites during a period of one and a half years on a
daily basis. The following table gives an overview of the collected data (with
the Web sites anonymized):
