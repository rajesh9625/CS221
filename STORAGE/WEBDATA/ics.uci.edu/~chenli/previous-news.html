 (12/12/2007) Today I attended a local computer industry forum 
about the computer cluster workforce in Orange County.  There is
an excellent survey
on the needs of computer cluster workforce in the county.  One interesting
finding is that the county is facing the challenge of not being able
to find enough workers in the IT industry.  The survey also gives
us some thoughts on how we design our education curriculum to meet the
need of the industry.



 (12/2007) I am looking for a motivated BS/MS student for an
  independent research project.  Requirements: strong java
  programming skills.  Please contact me if you are interested.

(6/2007) Summer: My students, Ray and Yiming, will be doing
summer internships at Microsoft Research and IBM T.J. Watson,
respectively.  I will be traveling early summer in China, attending
conferences and visting schools and companies. After that, I will be
working with my students, postdoc, and visitors at UCI.  There are
  several
very exciting ideas I would like to pursue.

be working on projects related to data integration.

(9/2006) Google Research Award:  I received a Google Research
Award in the amount of $37,500 renewable for a second year.  It will be
used to support my research on data cleaning, especially on approximate

this is the largest support I received from the industry.

(7/2006) Work on Data Exchange: Recently I finished a
technical report with Foto Afrati and Vassia Pavlaki (at NTUA, Greece)
titled "Data Exchange with Arithmetic Comparisons."  It is a work we
have been working on for almost one year: all of us went to Stanford
for one week, and Vassia visited UCI twice. It took us a lot of time
to think about all the subtle issues that are not covered in the excellent
paper on data exchange by Fagin et al.  I am glad that finally we
completed the work, and I really like it.

(6/2006) Summer: My student, Ray, is doing a summer internship at
Yahoo!.  My other students are working with me during the summer.  I
will have two visitors (Xiaochun Yang and Bin Wang).
I will visit a few places (IBM, SRI,
Yahoo, Google, possibly Toronto, and VLDB in Korea).  Well, these will
keep me busy enough, not to mention I have two sons to play with :-)


(5/2006) New PhD Student: I am glad that a new student, Yiming Lu,
is joining our PhD program soon.  He graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong
University with a BS and an MS, and has been working on data quality

 (5/2006) Work on Query Relaxation: Our paper titled Relaxing Join and
Selection Queries (joint work with Nick Koudas, Anthony Tung, and
my student, Rares Vernica) will appear in VLDB 2006, Seoul, Korea.  It
is about how to relax empty-answer SQL queries in RDBMS in order to
compute answers for users with a minimal relaxation.  We use skyline
as our relaxation framework, in which we need to consider join
conditions as well.  The work extends our previous work on supporting
approximate query answering in applications such as data cleaning.
See our two VLDB'2005 papers on similar topics.

 (5/2006) CleanDB Workshop: I am currently organizing the
CleanDB Workshop with Dongwon Lee. It will be
