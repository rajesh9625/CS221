        I am a 3rd year PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Irvine.  Padhraic Smyth is my advisor, and I am a member of his DataLab research group.  My research interests reside in both the theory and application of neural networks and other latent variable models.  I've done research internships at Amazon, building Deep Learning systems for product recommendations, and at Microsoft Research / Bing (under Rich Caruana and Nick Craswell), investigating word embeddings for information retrieval.
