Visit ICS






We can offer virtual tours, pictorials and viewbooks but nothing
          will substitute for an in-person visit.

The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) is
            the first and only computer science school in the University of California,
            offering
            visitors opportunities to attend academic lectures, interact with
            leading computer science researchers and recruit intelligent and
          out of the box thinking computer science students.
If you're interested
          in attending ICS and want to learn more about a particular degree program
          - even
            meet with faculty doing research that piques your interest - please call the Student Affairs Office at (949) 824-5156 and ask to speak to an undergraduate or graduate counselor.  
 Campus walking tours are offered almost every Monday through Friday. Please check the Tour Calendar for available times and to ensure that there is a tour offered on the day you wish to visit.
