Dear Bren School Community,
It is my pleasure to introduce the 2005-06 Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences Annual Report. Through our annual report we hope to keep you – our close friends and colleagues – abreast of our accomplishments, as well as challenges.
Today, we are an academic community of more than 1,500 students, over 100 full-time faculty and staff, and approximately 6,500 alumni worldwide. In teaching and scholarship, we continue to be among the top in information and computer sciences. The Chronicle of Higher Education ranked us third in Information Sciences research. 
I invite you stay in touch with us throughout the year by subscribing to our RSS feed or visiting our Web site regularly.
Many thanks for your continued support of our vision as well as our research and education. 

Debra J. Richardson
