Meet the Dean




 Hal S. Stern, Ph.D.  Ted and Janice Smith Family Foundation Dean  Professor of Statistics
Hal Stern, professor of statistics and dean of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, leads the school in its mission of providing computer science and information technology leadership for the 21st century through research and development of emerging technologies; collaborations that address societal concerns; and innovative and broad curricula.
Stern came to UC Irvine in 2002 as the founding chair of the Department of Statistics. That department has since grown to include nine faculty and about 40 graduate students who are enrolled in its M.S./Ph.D. programs. In 2010, Stern was named the Ted and Janice Smith Family Foundation Dean of the Donald Bren School. Prior to joining UCI, he was a professor of statistics and the Laurence H. Baker Chair in Biological Statistics at Iowa State University’s Department of Statistics. He also previously served on the faculty at Harvard University.
Within the field of statistics, Stern is known for his research work in Bayesian statistical methodology and model assessment techniques. He has authored more than 100 publications (over 80 of which were refereed) and is a co-author of the highly regarded graduate-level statistics text Bayesian Data Analysis. The hallmark of his work is interdisciplinary research collaboration wherein modern statistical methodology is developed to address needs that arise from ongoing scientific research in a variety of fields. Over the years, this has included applications in the social sciences, biological/health sciences, physical sciences and sports. Stern is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. He is extremely active in the statistics community, having recently served as editor of the American Statistical Association’s premier journal and previously serving as editor of Chance magazine. He has also served on several expert committees for the U.S. National Academies.
Stern received a B.S. degree in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1981, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in statistics from Stanford University in 1985 and 1987, respectively.
