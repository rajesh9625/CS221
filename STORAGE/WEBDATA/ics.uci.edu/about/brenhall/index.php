Donald Bren Hall




		  
The six-story Donald Bren Hall  expanded the existing Bren School campus and increased general assignment classroom space by more than 90,800 square feet. 
The design of this facility is intended to enhance interaction between faculty and students and to create a progressive learning environment. 
Designed with flexibility in mind, the building  accommodates the Bren School's  growing faculty, staff and student populations. 
The first classes in Donald Bren Hall were held Jan. 5, 2007; the Dean's office moved in on Jan. 8, 2007. 
On June 20, Donald Bren Hall was offically dedicated during a morning ceremony which was attended by Donald Bren, former Dean Debra J. Richardson, Chancellor Michael Drake and about 400 campus and community guests.
An open house followed the ceremony, allowing the on-campus and off-campus community a rare sneak peek into the school's  various research projects and their global impact on everyday lives. 
Donald Bren Hall accommodates: 
More than 125 faculty offices90 research labs, wet labs and/or offices10 classrooms (from 30-seat to 65-seat)250-seat lecture hall125-seat lecture hall2 50-seat lecture hallDean's office/administrative supportDepartmental officesBren School  staff offices/facilities
Ceremonial groundbreaking on Donald Bren Hall took place on June 9, 2004. Visitors can view the groundbreaking press release as well as photos from the groundbreaking ceremony, attended by the building's namesake, philanthropist and chairman of The Irvine Company, Donald Bren.
