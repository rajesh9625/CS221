			  Donald Bren, Dean Debra J. Richardson, Chancellor Michael Drake and about 400 campus and community guests celebrated the opening of Donald Bren Hall June 20. 
              Bren participated in a ceremonial ribbon cutting, toured the building’s laboratories and saw faculty research displays. Joining Bren at the event were Chancellor Drake; his wife, Brenda;  Assemblyman Todd Spitzer; Orange County Supervisor Bill Campbell; and Irvine Mayor Beth Krom.
              Both the school and building were named in honor of Irvine Company Chairman Donald Bren, whose $20 million gift bolstered the school's efforts. 
              Bren Hall is the new home of the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, a nationally ranked program that promotes cutting-edge research and interdisciplinary learning.
              An open house  followed the dedication ceremony, allowing the on campus and off-campus community a rare sneak peak into the school's various research projects and their global impact on everyday lives.  
              To learn more about some of these innovative and collaborative projects, please view these informational videos.

              A collection of media articles about the event is also available.
