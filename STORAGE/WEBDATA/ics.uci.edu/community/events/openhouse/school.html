The Bren School campus, Donald Bren Hall (top left), ICS 2 (middle), ICS 1 (bottom right)




 Founded as a department in 1968, information and computer science became the first computer science school in the University of California System in December 2002.
As an independent school focused solely on the computer and information
            sciences, the Bren School has a unique perspective on the information technology
            disciplines that allows it a broad foundation from which to build
            educational programs and research initiatives that explore the many
            applications of the computing discipline; from circuits and systems
            to software engineering and human aspects of computing.
