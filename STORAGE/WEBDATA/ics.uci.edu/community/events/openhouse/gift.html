The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences was made possible by the generous $20 million gift from Orange County business leader and philanthropist Donald Bren, chairman of The Irvine Company.
Mr. Bren's gift equaled the largest single gift ever to UC Irvine at the time and has created the most endowed faculty positions at one time on any University of California campus.
              In recognition of this transformational gift, the school, renowned worldwide for leading the innovation of new information and computing technologies and producing an educated work force to fuel the economic engine, was renamed the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences during a June 9, 2003 ceremony.
              At this event, Mr. Bren was also awarded the University of California Presidential Medal, recognizing his significant contributions to UC and higher education. The medal is the university's highest honor.
              This historic gift accelerated the school's plans for achieving its overarching goal of becoming a top ten computer science program within five years and has had a transformational impact on students,
              faculty, alumni and community friends of the Bren School.
              In 2005, Ramesh Jain, professor of embedded and experiential systems at Georgia Institute of Technology, was named the first Donald Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences at UC Irvine. 
              Jain is a renowned pioneer in multimedia information systems, image databases, machine vision and intelligent systems, a collection of work that is classed as experiential computing - exploring information through the senses.
