To see what time you visited a particular floor of Donald Bren Hall during the June 20th Open House just input your first and last name as it appears on the RFID tag located on the back of the passport you received the day of the event. 
On the day of the Bren Hall dedication there were 428 tags handed out and 2,567 readings were taken by the RFID readers located on Floors 1 - 5.
RFID can have difficulty in transmitting clean radio signals when the tag is obstructed from the reader, i.e. by placing the tag in your pocket or through tag collision which can occur when many tags are present in a small area.
Due to these difficulties, there is a chance your RFID tag may not have been read by  any or all of the RFID readers. 
The Bren School would like to thank Project ResCUE for configuring the RFID readers and compiling the RFID tag data.
