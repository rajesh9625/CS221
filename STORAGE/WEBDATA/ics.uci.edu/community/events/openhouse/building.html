			  The six-story Donald Bren Hall  expands the existing Bren School campus and increase general assignment classroom space by more than 90,800 square feet. 
              The design of this facility is intended to enhance interaction between faculty and students and to create a progressive learning environment. 
              Designed with flexibility in mind, the building  accommodates the Bren School's  growing faculty, staff and student populations. 
              The first classes in Donald Bren Hall were held January 5th, 2007 and the Dean's office moved in on January 8th, 2007.
              Join us at our virtual Donald Bren Hall created in Second Life by Crista Lopes' students to allow visitors to share in our open house no matter where in the physical world they are located.
