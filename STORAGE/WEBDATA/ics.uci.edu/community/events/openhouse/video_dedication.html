                  Donald Bren, Dean Debra J. Richardson, Chancellor Michael Drake and about 400 campus and community guests celebrated the opening of Donald Bren Hall during an 11:30 PST ceremony on June 20, 2007.
                  An open house followed the ribbon cutting, allowing the on campus and off-campus community a rare sneak peak into the school's various research projects and their global impact on everyday lives.
