What is RSS?
        RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is an XML-based format for sharing and  distributing Web content, such as news headlines. Using an RSS reader,  you can view data feeds from various  sources, such as the Bren School of ICS,  including headlines, summaries, links to full stories. 
How do I access RSS?
        RSS/News Aggregators (also called Readers) will download and display  RSS feeds for you. A number of free and commercial News Aggregators are  available for download. Many aggregators are separate, "stand-alone" programs; other services  will let you add RSS feeds to a Web page.

		How do I get a News Reader?
		Various programs and other web sites can use RSS. Some web sites include My
		Yahoo and My MSN, which allow you to add RSS streams to your personal pages.
		There are also standalone programs you can download and run that will allow
