SUMMER 2014





Kobsa to co-chair recommender systems conference in Silicon Valley

 Alfred  Kobsa 


Informatics and computer science professor Alfred Kobsa will co-chair the 8th Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2014), held Oct. 6-10 in Silicon Valley’s Foster City. The conference is the premier international forum for the presentation of new research results, systems and techniques in the broad field of recommender systems. Such systems, as part of broader information filtering system networks, attempt to predict user preferences and ratings for items by exploiting users’ past behaviors. Their use has surged in popularity in recent years. 


According to the website, the conference “will bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their latest results and identify new trends and challenges in providing recommendation components in a range of innovative application contexts.” Netflix’s chief product officer Neil Hunt will deliver the keynote speech, titled “Quantifying the Value of Better Recommendations.”


Kobsa praised Silicon Valley as an ideal location for RecSys 2014, saying that it “allows local high-tech industry to learn about the most recent research results in recommender technology.” Attracting local industry has proved successful: Tickets to the conference sold out before the early registration deadline.

 











Nicolau and Veidenbaum published in computing retrospective

 Alex  Nicolau 


 Alex  Veidenbaum 


Computer science chair Alex Nicolau and professor Alex Veidenbaum have each been published in the 25th anniversary volume of the International Conference on Supercomputing. The volume is a collection of author retrospectives for the best papers published in the first 25 years of the conference — the Association for Computing Machinery's flagship conference in high-performance computing. Thirty-five papers were selected for their impact on the field, out of the approximately 1000 papers published in the first 25 years of the conference. 


Nicolau’s paper “A Global Resource-Constrained Parallelization Technique,” co-authored with Kemal Ebcioğlu and originally published in 1989, helped to innovate the obstacle-ridden process of automatic parallelization of arbitrary sequential code. In their retrospective on the paper, Nicolau and Ebcioğlu remark, “Automatic parallelization of arbitrary sequential code remains an exciting and active area as of today, and promising research and industry efforts continue.”


Veidenbaum’s paper “Compiler-Directed Data Prefetching in Multiprocessors with Memory Hierarchies,” co-authored with Edward H. Gornish and Elana D. Granston, was the first paper on compiler-managed data prefetching for multiprocessor systems with caches. Prefetching is used to reduce large memory access times. The group explains in their retrospective that compiler-prefetching algorithms used in memory management have not changed much since the paper’s original publishing in 1990. They ask: “Are there better ways to do it for today's hardware?”

 











Baldi, Kobsa, Mark receive Google Faculty Research Awards

 Pierre  Baldi 


AlfredKobsa


GloriaMark


Three ICS professors have received a Google Faculty Research Award as part of Google’s biannual open call for proposals in computer science, engineering and related fields. Computer science Chancellor’s Professor Pierre Baldi, informatics and computer science professor Alfred Kobsa and informatics professor Gloria Mark join several other ICS faculty who have received the award in recent years. 


As part of Google’s mission to “organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,” Faculty Research Awards identify and support faculty pursuing research of mutual interest at internationally renowned universities. The award is an unrestricted gift, and is typically funded at the amount needed to support one graduate student for one year.


Baldi received $65,000 for his proposal, “Deep Learning and Dropout.” The proposal studies the properties of dropout — a recently introduced deep learning approach with applications in computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing — and seeks to develop optimized randomization strategies and algorithms for deep learning, to be applied to challenging problems in the natural sciences and other areas.


Kobsa received $60,000 for his proposal, “Predicting People’s Privacy Preferences for Ubiquitous Personal Data Disclosure,” which will investigate the predictability of user privacy preferences in a ubiquitous personal data disclosure scenario. In a world where apps and websites increasingly ask users to make privacy decisions, predicted privacy preferences may allow for a balance between desired privacy and personal data disclosure.


Mark’s proposal, “In Situ Precision-tracking of Online Behavior: A Comprehensive View of Focus, Mood and Context,” garnered $64,000. Her work seeks to understand how people's focus, mood and stress change while using digital media in a real-world context, through precision tracking using wearable sensors and other methods.

 











ICS team earns honorable mention at programming contest in Russia




A team of ICS undergrads garnered an honorable mention at the Association for Computing Machinery’s 
International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals
held in Ekaterinburg, Russia in late June. The team known as UCI Constructors — consisting of 
Nick Alajat, Alan Castro and Michael Cappe 
— finished 88th out of 122 teams, beating out fellow North American competitors UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University, among others.


Computer science senior lecturer Richard Pattis, who sponsored the team, pointed out that UCI Constructors was the first UCI team in over a decade to qualify for the world finals. “These students resurrected competitive programming at UCI,” Pattis declared.


During a five-hour span, international teams tackled 12 difficult programming questions. The UCI team was able to solve one problem, while the winning team from Russia’s St. Petersburg State University solved seven.


“The World Finals were just as difficult as we expected them to be,” explained Gio Borje, coach of UCI Constructors and chair of UC Irvine’s ACM chapter. “Relative to other West Coast teams, UC Irvine had a great start at the beginning of the competition by solving the first problem faster than the others, but eventually the other teams caught up.” 


Apart from competing, the team was able to squeeze in some sightseeing and tour the Iset River in Ekaterinburg. 


UCI Constructors had 
taken second place 
in ICPC’s Southern California Regional last year. This year’s tournament starts up again soon, with the Southern California Regional taking place at Riverside Community College Nov. 8.

 











Jain co-authors textbook on multimedia computing

   
 Ramesh  Jain 





Professor Ramesh Jain has recently published a new textbook on multimedia computing. Co-written with Gerald Friedland, director of audio and multimedia research at the International Computer Science Institute (a private research lab affiliated with UC Berkeley), the book is simply titled 
Multimedia Computing.


The textbook presents emerging techniques in multimedia computing, treating each medium — audio, images, text, etc. — as a strong component of the complete exchange of information. 


“The multimedia field needed a textbook,” states Mubarak Shah, a professor at the University of Central Florida, in his back-cover blurb for the book, “and it is finally here.”


Jain and Friedland introduce the fundamentals of multimedia computing, describing the properties of perceptually encoded information; presenting common algorithms and concepts for handling it; and outlining the typical requirements for emerging applications that use diverse information sources. Designed for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate courses, the book also serves as an introduction for engineers and researchers interested in understanding the elements of multimedia and their role in building specific applications.

 











Smyth gives keynote talk at top artificial intelligence conference

 Padhraic  Smyth 


Professor Padhraic Smyth 
gave an invited keynote talk 
at the recent AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-14). Held July 27-31 in Québec City, Canada, the conference promotes research in artificial intelligence and scientific exchange among AI researchers, practitioners, scientists and engineers in affiliated disciplines. More than 400 papers were presented at the conference, which attracted more than 1000 attendees from North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.


Smyth's talk, titled “30 Years of Probability in AI and Machine Learning,” discussed the historical development of AI and machine learning algorithms in the context of probabilistic and statistical foundations, as well as potential future directions for the field. Smyth described how probabilistic and statistical thinking is a key aspect of developing machine learning solutions for many diverse data-driven problems in areas like computer vision, computational advertising, text mining, bioinformatics and climate science.


Founded in 1979, the nonprofit Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (formerly the American Association for Artificial Intelligence) seeks to further “research in, and responsible use of, artificial intelligence,” per 
the group’s website.

 











Van der Hoek and LaToza receive $1.4 million from NSF to study “crowdprogramming”

 André  van der Hoek 


ThomasLaToza


Informatics professor André van der Hoek and postdoctoral scholar Thomas LaToza have received a $1.4 million grant over four years from the National Science Foundation for their research into what they have termed “crowdprogramming.”


Where crowdsourcing leverages the power of mass individual input to complete tasks that were previously too labor-intensive to be feasible or even possible, van der Hoek and LaToza propose applying those same principles to software development. Their research will address the fundamental question of how the nature of software affects what may and may not be possible in terms of crowdsourcing.


In their NSF-funded project, the pair will develop theoretical understandings of crowd programming in terms of whether it can be achieved, in which form, under what conditions and with which benefits and drawbacks; and also create a publicly available crowdsourcing platform, CrowdCode, that will offers a tool set specifically designed to address the intricacies of crowdprogramming.

 











Statistics graduate student places second in prestigious biometrics competition

SepehrAkhavan


Sepehr Akhavan, a statistics Ph.D. student, has placed second in the student paper competition at the Western North America Region (WNAR) conference of the International Biometric Society. The twenty submissions for this prestigious award included papers from statistics and biostatistics departments at Stanford, UC Berkeley, UCLA and the University of Washington.


Akhavan’s paper, titled “A Flexible Joint Longitudinal-Survival Model For Quantifying The Association Between Within-Subject Volatility In Serum Biomarkers and Mortality,” proposes a statistical method for tracking albumin, an important biological marker, in patients undergoing dialysis treatment for kidney disease. By identifying potentially dangerous fluctuations in albumin levels, Akhavan’s model seeks to reduce the mortality rate among this critically ill population. The project is being co-supervised by professor Dan Gillen and associate professor Babak Shahbaba.


Founded in 1948, WNAR is devoted to sharing the applications of statistics and mathematics to biology. Gillen points out that the Bren School’s statistics department has had a student place first or second in this competition for three of the past four years.

 













SPRING 2014





RWJF grants $1.9 million to project co-led by Bietz

MatthewBietz


The Health Data Exploration Project—co-led by informatics assistant project scientist Matthew Bietz—has received a $1.9 million grant from 
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
(RWJF) to create a network of researchers, scientists, companies and others to catalyze the use of personal health data for the public good.


The Health Data Exploration Project, 
a multi-campus collaboration led by the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2), seeks to establish a network that will “bring together companies that collect and store personal health data, captured through the use of wearable devices, smartphone apps and social media, with researchers who mine these data for patterns and trends and other strategic partners,” according to a 
press release about the grant.


The network is inspired by findings about health-related data sharing practices, which were published in The Health Data Exploration project’s recent report 
“Personal Data for the Public Good.” 
The report was also funded by RWJF, the nation’s largest health-focused philanthropic organization.

 











Kobsa receives $70,000 grant from Intel Labs for research on users’ privacy decision-making

AlfredKobsa


Intel Labs has awarded informatics and computer science professor Alfred Kobsa a $70,000 grant for his research on users’ privacy decision-making in the context of mobile and ubiquitous computing. 


Computer users are increasingly asked to make privacy decisions, but research has shown that such decisions are cumbersome and difficult. Kobsa’s research proposes a “privacy adaptation procedure” that predicts users’ decisions through machine learning, and sets personal default privacy preferences accordingly. 


The research is in the vein of Intel’s “context-aware” computing—in which devices anticipate user needs and desires and help fulfill them before users ask.


Kobsa’s proposed “privacy adaptation procedure” could allow Intel to act as an information broker between the user and the app developer. This information broker could provide privacy decision support in two ways: by informing the app about the users’ privacy preferences, which the app can then use to determine permissible requests; and by providing a safe subset of the users’ personal information to the app without user intervention, based on its predictions about the users’ disclosure preferences. The research maintains that in either case, the user should choose the level of automation.

Gabrielova receives Palantir Scholarship for Women in Technology

 Eugenia  Gabrielova 


ICS Ph.D. student Eugenia Gabrielova has received the Palantir Scholarship for Women in Technology. The scholarship supports women in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) disciplines by aiding them in their academic careers and providing them with opportunities to learn from other women making a difference through technological innovation. Initially established in 2012 to serve underrepresented populations in computer science, the scholarship was expanded this year to all women in the STEM disciplines who may rely on Palantir’s technology in their work, according to a recent news brief publicizing the scholarship finalists. 


Gabrielova’s research interests include virtual worlds, large-scale scientific data exploration and self-managing software systems. She works under the guidance of professor Crista Lopes, and is affiliated with the Mondego Lab, which focuses on research in large systems and large data.


Palantir is a mission-focused software and services company whose data fusion platforms are used in “the most difficult problems facing the world’s most critical institutions: finding missing and exploited children, combatting terrorism, enabling hundreds of thousands of homeowners to avoid foreclosure, preventing the spread of foodborne illness,” among other issues, according to the Palantir Scholarship for Women in Technology website. 

 
















WINTER 2014





Journal features Baldi and team’s research on diet and circadian rhythm

 Pierre  Baldi 


Chancellor's Professor Pierre Baldi was part of a team whose study was featured in the December 2013 issue of the life science journal Cell. Baldi, director of the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, played a key role in the study, collecting and analyzing highly complex genetic data.


Titled “Reprogramming of the Circadian Clock by Nutritional Challenge,” the paper reveals a surprising connection between diets and gene oscillation, finding that a high-fat diet (HFD) generates a profound reorganization of specific metabolic pathways, leading to disruption of the normal circadian cycle regulated by the liver clock. 


The research also demonstrates that the nutritional challenge specifically, and not the development of obesity, causes reprogramming of the liver clock. This indicates that the reprogramming takes place independent of the state of obesity and that the effects of diet on the liver clock are reversible.

 
















ICS research team published in RWJF report on personal health data

 Judith  Gregory 


The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) has published a report titled 
“Personal Data for the Public Good: New Opportunities to Enrich Understanding of Individual and Population Health,” to which ICS associate adjunct professor Judith Gregory and assistant project scientists Matthew Bietz and Scout Calvert contributed. The report examines attitudes toward personal health data from the individuals who self-track personal data; the companies designing self-tracking devices, apps, or services; and the researchers who might use the data.


The report is a culmination of research that comes out of the Health Data Exploration project, a multi-campus collaboration led by the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2) with support from RWJF — the nation’s largest health-focused philanthropic organization. Key findings include: high willingness of individuals to share self-tracked data for research with assured privacy; how current methods of informed consent are challenged by the use and reuse of personal health data in research; and researcher enthusiasm for personal health data tempered by concern for its validity and the lack of standardization of devices.

Mark to participate in SXSW panel on focus in the workplace

GloriaMark


South by Southwest (SXSW) has invited professor Gloria Mark to participate in a panel discussion at this year's Music, Film and Interactivity conference on March 8 in Austin, Texas. Titled 
“Workplace Distractions: A New Focus on Focus,” 
the panel will “explore the latest research to understand the importance of focus in the workplace, the cost of workplace distraction, how to stay focused in the midst of a chaotic workplace, and despite recent research to the contrary, why focus perhaps is not all it is cracked up to be,” according to the SXSW website.


Joining Mark will be Gensler workplace architect Janet Pogue and Sociometric Solutions CEO Ben Waber, with Wall Street Journal reporter Rachel Silverman moderating. Mark will discuss her research using sensors to track how mood and stress is related to digital activity in the workplace.

This award recognizes the best paper from the DASFAA proceedings 10 years prior based on the criterion that the paper has had the biggest impact—in research, products, or methodology—over the last decade. Mehrotra was also a winner of the DASFAA 10-year best paper award in 2013.


DASFAA serves as a forum for academic exchanges and technical discussions among researchers, developers and users of databases from academia, business and industry. DASFAA 2014 will be held in Bali, Indonesia, in April.

 











Gary and Judith Olson receive NSF grant for distributed-work study

GaryOlson


JudithOlson


The National Science Foundation has awarded a grant to Bren Professors 
Gary Olson and Judith Olson 
for their project “Micro-Analytics of Collaboration in Distributed Work: What Makes Collaboration Work.”


The study is a four-phase examination of the micro-processes of collaborative document creation to identify what processes and tool features ensure a high-quality end product — and to determine what new features might contribute to more successful collaborations. Distributed work has become ubiquitous in industry as well as in the sciences, but, as the project abstract notes, current theories of collaborative work were generated when technology-supported distributed work was less common. With the help of nearly $397,000 in NSF funding, the Olsons will expand these theories to include the collaboration patterns when people use new tools and cope with the challenges of being distant.

 











Carey and Li receive $1.1 million in funding for AsterixDB research

ChenLi


Professors Michael Carey and Chen Li have received $750,000 from the National Science Foundation and nearly $400,000 from corporations — including Google, Oracle and HTC — to continue the development of their Big Data system, AsterixDB.


Carey, Li and UCI project scientist Vinayak Borkar developed the system in collaboration with Vassilis J. Tsotras, a professor at the University of California, Riverside. AsterixDB promises to be the most versatile among platforms aimed at managing Big Data; the open source software is now available for free download at 
http://asterix.ics.uci.edu.


The AsterixDB engine operates on a “shared nothing” architecture, in which each computer node is independent and self-sufficient. Its distinct advantages come by adding management of semi-structured data (data not organized in the traditional tabular form), supporting a variety of data types (e.g., spatial and temporal as well as textual and numeric data), and borrowing techniques from parallel databases that increase the speed and scale at which it can operate.

 











ICS grad students take second place in sbv IMPROVER competition

PeterSadowski


MichaelZeller


Peter Sadowski and Michael Zeller, both Ph.D. students with the Department of Computer Science, earned a second-place finish in an international data-mining competition. The honor was given by sbv IMPROVER, a collaborative project designed to enable scientists to learn about and contribute to the development of a new crowdsourcing method for verification of scientific data and results. 


Sadowski and Zeller, students in professor Pierre Baldi’s group and researchers at the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics, developed a pipeline for translating protein phosphorylation status from rat primary lung cells to human primary lung cells after subjecting cells to various stimuli consisting of known drugs and chemicals. Their pipeline consisted of two parts: an artificial neural network; and a statistical analysis that aggregated evidence from the replicated measurements. They placed second out of 13 teams and were awarded travel-cost reimbursement to the 2013 sbv IMPROVER Symposium in Athens, Greece, where they presented their findings.

 










Judith and Gary Olson release new book on distributed collaborations

JudithOlson


GaryOlson


Professors Judith Olson and Gary Olson have 
published a new book, 
titled Working Together Apart: Collaboration over the Internet. Published by Morgan & Claypool Publishers, the Olsons’ new offering reviews the latest insights into how teams work together when they are not in the same location. 


Guided by a framework they developed during two decades of research on this topic, the professors organize a series of factors they have found to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful distributed collaborations. They then review the kinds of technology options that are available today, focusing more on types of technologies rather than specific instances. They describe a database of geographically distributed projects they have studied and introduce the Collaboration Success Wizard, an online tool for assessing past, present, or planned distributed collaborations. The book closes with a set of recommendations for individuals, managers, and those higher in the organizations who wish to support distance work.

ACCESS features Regan’s article on vehicular communication networks

AmeliaRegan


In the latest issue of 
ACCESS Magazine, professor Amelia Regan explores the implications of vehicular communication networks. Such systems allow vehicles to sense not only traffic patterns, but also dangers outside a driver’s line of sight. These abilities improve driving efficiency and safety and are the first steps towards an automated driving network. But what happens if the communication network fails? Or worse, is hacked into?


Regan’s article, “Vehicular ad hoc Networks: Storms on the Horizon,” describes the advantages and challenges these networks present. While the latest technology turns both cars and even pedestrians into nodes on the network, issues of security, privacy and liability continue to be major barriers to broad implementation. 


ACCESS Magazine highlights research funded by the University of California Transportation Center, presenting academic work to policymakers, practitioners and the public.
