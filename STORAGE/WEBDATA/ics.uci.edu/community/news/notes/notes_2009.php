DECEMBER 2009

                Tsudik and Uzun
 awarded Google Research Award
                
                   
                   Gene Tsudik
                
                Gene Tsudik and Ersin Uzun
 (PhD Candidate, Netsys Program) have been awarded a Google Research
                   Award for $50,000 for a research effort entitled "Secure and Usable Group Association of Personal Wireless Devices."
                The goal of this research is to come up, and 
experiment with, scalable, and usable techniques for spontaneous 
*secure*
                   association among a group of wireless devices and 
gadgets. The group device association problem arises whenever a set of
                   individuals, each "armed" with a personal wireless 
device, want to set up a common secure communication channel for the 
purpose
                   of a short-term meeting or a longer-term 
collaboration. It also figures prominently in emergency response and law
 enforcement
                   settings. 
                This project dovetails from a larger NSF-funded 
project (jointly with Professor Alfred Kobsa) on secure
 and
                   usable association of wireless devices. 
                Tsudik's research interests are mainly in 
computer/network security, privacy and applied cryptography. His recent 
work focuses on
                   privacy in Internet services, RFID systems and mobile
 ad hoc networks, as well as security in sensor networks and storage 
systems.
                   His research also covers secure group communication, 
in particular, group key agreement, group signatures and group access 
control. 


                



                Tsudik

science, has been appointed Cor Wit Chair at Delft University of 
Technology in
                   the Netherlands. 
                Established in 2003 by the Cor Wit Foundation, the 
Cor Wit chair is awarded annually to international researchers in the 
field of
                   telecommunications and computer systems whose 
research focuses on the interface of technology and society. Gene 
Tsudik's core
                   research is in Network Security & Privacy with  
emphasis on cryptographic protocols in the context of wireless, sensor 
and mobile
                   ad hoc networks. 
                Recipients are invited to work in the 
Telecommunications Department of the Faculty Electrical Engineering, 
Mathematics and
                   Computer Science (EEMCS) at Delft University of 
Technology. 
                Associate Dean Magda El Zarki was 
previously appointed Cor Wit chair in 2006. 
                Tsudik's research interests are mainly in 
computer/network security, privacy and applied cryptography. His recent 
work focuses on
                   privacy in Internet services, RFID systems and mobile
 ad hoc networks, as well as security in sensor networks and storage

                Lopes 
speaks at Intel CTO  keynote address
                 
                  Prof. Cristina Lopes (UCI, Informatics), Justin 
Rattner (CTO Intel)
                
                Cristina Lopes, Associate Professor 
of Informatics participated as a guest speaker in the keynote address at
                   SuperComputing '09 in Portland Oregon.  The Keynote 
was delivered by Justin Rattner, CTO of Intel.  Lopes was a guest at 
Rattner's
                   keynote, in her role as one of the main architects of
 OpenSim. 
                Justin Rattner's opening keynote address at 
SuperComputing'09 message addressed how the super-computing industry has
 stagnated, and
                   the only thing that will save it from collapse is a 
drastic change on what people think of as "super-computing." Other 
guests were
                   Aaron Duffy, a biology researcher at Utah State 
University, and Shenlei Winkler, CEO of the Fashion Design Institute. 
                Lopes' research is related to languages and 
communication systems. The ultimate goal of her research is to deepen 
the knowledge
                   about communication, in particular in systems that 
involve humans and machines. With this utopic goal in mind, she has done
 work in
                   a variety of fields such as programming languages, 
security and applications of audio signal processing. 


             



                Navarro,
 Van der Hoek win Premier Award for SimSe
                 
                
                Project scientist Emily Navarro and 
Associate Dean André van der Hoek have been
                   recognized with the 2009 Premier Award for SimSE, a 
game-based educational software engineering simulation environment that
                   allows students to practice "virtual" software 
engineering processes in a graphical, interactive and fun setting.
                SimSE's direct, graphical feedback enables students 
to learn the complex cause and effect relationships underlying software
                   engineering processes. During the game, the student 
takes on the role of the project manager and directs engineers to 
perform
                   typical process tasks. 
                SimSE helps bridge the gap between the conceptual 
knowledge about software engineering that is presented in lecture but 
that
                   often times is not fully explored or practiced in 
assignments or projects. 
                SimSE includes a customizable modeling environment 
that allows instructors to create new scenarios, application domains,
                   organizations and cultures. SimSE has been used 
worldwide and has been found to be an educationally effective tool that
                   increases students' understanding of software 
engineering process concepts. 
                Van der Hoek's research focuses on understanding and 
advancing the role of design, coordination, and education in software
                   engineering. He has authored and co-authored over 80 
peer-reviewed journal and conference publications, and in 2006 was a
                   recipient of an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper 
Award. He is a co-author of the 2005 Configuration Management Impact 
Report as
                   well as the 2007 Futures of Software Engineering 
Report on Software Design and Architecture.

             OCTOBER 2009


             Southern California Computer Vision 
Meet-Up brings over 80 local researchers to UC Irvine

             On October 30, 2009, the Computational Vision group at 
UC Irvine hosted the second annual Southern California
                Computer Vision Meetup, a day of talks and discussion on
 the latest results in computer vision.  Topics of discussion
                ranged from surveillance and automotive safety, to 
differentiating white blood cells by qualitatively analyzing a single
                image. 
             Over 80 researchers attended the day-long event, 
including faculty and students from UC Irvine, USC, UC Riverside, UCLA,
                UC San Diego, and Caltech, as well as researchers from 
JPL, Google and Evolution Robotics. 
             The Computational Vision Lab studies computational 
vision, seeking to understand both the information processing
                capabilities of biological visual systems and develop 
computer vision systems. Researchers are interested in theoretical
                questions as well as practical applications ranging from
 motion capture to biological image analysis.

             Majumder, Sajadi receive 
paper award at IEEE Visualization
              
               AditiMajumder
             
             A paper entitled, "Markerless View-Independent 
Registration of Multiple Distorted Projectors on Extruded Surfaces
                Using an Uncalibrated Camera" by Computer Science 
professor Aditi Majumder and graduate student
                Behzad Sajadi has won the runner up in 
the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Visualization 2009 conference
                held in Atlantic City this month. 
             The paper presents the first algorithm to geometrically 
register multiple projectors in a view-independent manner on a
                common type of curved surface, vertically extruded 
surface, using an uncalibrated camera without attaching any
                obtrusive markers to the display screen. This simple 
markerless registration has the potential to have a large impact
                on easy set-up and maintenance of large curved 
multi-projector displays, common for visualization, edutainment,
                training and simulation applications. 
             IEEE Visualization is the premier annual forum for 
visualization advances for academia, government, and industry.
                This event brings together researchers and practitioners
 with a shared interest in visualization tools, techniques, and
                technology. 
             Majumder's research addresses how to produce a seamless 
image on a large-scale tiled display - an important problem to
                both the scientific and entertainment fields.  She has 
developed a suite of mathematical models, methods and software
                to correct the geometric and color variations that arise
 when tiling multiple projection displays. 

             


             Kobsa 
named Associate Editor of new ACM journal
              
               AlfredKobsa
             
             Informatics Professor Alfred Kobsa has 
been appointed Associate Editor of the new "ACM Transactions on
                Intelligent Interactive Systems" (TIIS). The journal 
will publish research articles concerning the design, realization, 
and/or
                evaluation of interactive systems that exhibit some form
 of "intelligent" behavior. 
             The Journal's focus will be on sensing and perception, 
knowledge representation and reasoning, learning, creativity, planning,
                autonomous motion and manipulation, natural language 
processing, and social interaction. 
             Kobsa's research lies in the areas of user modeling and 
personalized systems (with applications in the areas of information
                environments, expert finders, and user interfaces for 
disabled and elderly people), privacy, and in information
                visualization. 
             He is also the editor of "User Modeling and User-Adapted
 Interaction: The Journal of Personalization Research", edited
                several books and authored numerous publications in the 
areas of user-adaptive systems, human-computer interaction and
                knowledge representation. 

             


             Fowlkes, Ramanan and Desai 
awarded
                Marr Prize in Kyoto, Japan
             
                
                CharlessFowlkes
                
                
                DevaRamanan
             
             A paper entitled "Discriminative models for multi-class 
object layout" by PhD student Chaitanya Desai
                and Assistant Professors Deva Ramanan 
and Charless Fowlkes received the Marr Prize at
                the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 
held the first week of October in Kyoto, Japan. 
             The prize is awarded to the best paper at ICCV and is 
considered one of the top honors in computer vision.  The award is
                named after David Marr, a theoretical neuroscientist who
 made profound contributions to the theory of both human and machine
                vision in the 1970's. 
             The paper describes research on a new approach to 
modeling contextual relations between objects in an image (e.g. bottles
                are often seen resting on top of tables but not the 
other way around). The system automatcially learns these relations from
                example images and uses this information to outperform 
existing approaches to object detection. 
             Fowlkes' research is in computational vision, both in 
understanding the information processing capabilities of the human
                visual system and in developing machine vision systems. 
He is also interested in applying computer vision techniques to
                automating the analysis of biological data and 
developing algorithmic tools for understanding morphology and spatial 
aspects
                of gene expression. 
             Ramanan's research interests span computer vision, 
machine learning, and computer graphics. His past work focused on the
                analysis of human movement from video, including 
tracking people and recognizing their actions.  Current interests 
include
                object recognition, large-scale image/video processing, 
structured-prediction approaches to learning, and activity recognition. 

             





             SEPTEMBER 2009
             Dourish
 receives $500,000 grant for social networking study in Kazakhstan, 
Russia
              
               Paul
                 Dourish
             
             Paul Dourish, Professor of Informatics,
 has received a $500,000 National Foundation Grant for his research 
entitle "From Local Ties to Transnational Connections: The Role of 
Computer-mediated Communication in Relational Maintenance."  The 
research is in collaboration with Irina Shklovski,  an assistant 
professor at the IT University in Copenhagen, Denmark, and formerly a 
post-doc at the Bren School.
             The focus of the grant is a study of the use of social 
networking software and web sites in Kazakhstan and Russia, looking at 
the cultural specificities of information technology use.
             The research investigates the ways culturally embedded 
expectations of personal networks shape the use of social network sites 
and other Internet-based social applications for relational maintenance.
 Dourish and Shklovski will also explore the way people reconnect with 
contacts that relocate to other cities and, more often, other countries 
and how such connections may define new transnational forms of 
belonging.
             Dourish's primary research interests are in the areas of
 Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Human-Computer Interaction, and 
Ubiquitous Computing. He is especially interested in the foundational 
relationships between social scientific analysis and technological 
design.

             Eppstein wins best paper award at WADS
              
               David
               Eppstein
             
             A paper by computer science professor David 
Eppstein and former ICS student  Kevin A. Wortman,
 "Optimal Embedding into Star Metrics," has received the best paper 
award from the 11th Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS), 
held this August in Banff, Canada.
             Their research concerns algorithms for choosing the 
location of a central facility such as an airline hub in order to 
minimize the increase in distance caused by traveling through the hub 
instead of taking a direct route.  The WADS best paper award was 
announced on the conference web site after the conference was held, and 
comes with a prize of 500 Euro in books from Springer-Verlag.
             Eppstein's research interests are varied and include 
geometric optimization, finite element mesh generation and mesh 
improvement, information visualization and graph drawing, robust 
statistics and estimation of web-graph properties, graph theory and 
graph algorithms, exponential-time algorithms for NP-hard problems, and 
cellular automata and combinatorial games.

             SCONCE

 Secure Computing & Networking Center (SCONCE) Ph.D. candidates Ersin
 Uzun and Yang Wang have been awarded the UCI 
Graduate Dean's Dissertation Fellowship for Fall 2009. 
             They are among only 25 recipients campus-wide. This 
fellowship frees students from non-research related employment, allowing
 them focus on completion of their dissertations.
             Uzun's research focuses on usable security and Wang's 
research revolves around balancing privacy and personalization.
             
             Franz
 receives $600,000 NSF CyberTrust Grant
              
               Michael
               Franz
             
             Michael Franz, Professor of Computer 
Science, has received a $600,000  grant from the National Science 
Foundation's CyberTrust program. His project with co-PI Cormac Flanagan 
from UC Santa Cruz will investigate next-generation infrastructure for 
trustworthy web applications.
             Many services traditionally performed by stand-alone 
programs running on desktop computers are being migrated to "Web 2.0" 
applications, remote services that reside "in the cloud" and are that 
accessed through a browser.  This migration process offers a unique 
opportunity to re-engineer the way that software is constructed, adding 
some extra capabilities that reduce the vulnerability of the global 
information infrastructure to problems such as viruses, cyber-attacks, 
loss of privacy, and integrity violations.
             With this goal in mind, this project designs and 
implements a next-generation infrastructure for trustworthy web 
applications. It evolves the existing Web 2.0 technologies into a more 
trustworthy "Web 2.Sec" version by introducing information-labeling and 
strong information-flow controls pervasively at the service provider, at
 the user's end, and on all paths in between.
             A key feature of the new Web 2.Sec architecture is that 
all application programs are executed on top of a virtual machine (VM) 
rather than directly on physical hardware. Hence the VM retains full 
control over the data at all times, allowing it to enforce 
information-þow policies that guarantee conÞdentiality and integrity. 
Even a malicious or faulty program running on top of the Web 2.Sec VM 
cannot cause any action that would violate these policies.
             Franz is an expert on virtual machines, mobile-code 
security, and dynamic compilation. He is the co-inventor (with a 
graduate student) of the Trace Compilation method that now drives 
JavaScript performance in Mozilla's Firefox browser. He has graduated 13
 Ph.D. students, been awarded more than $7 Million in competitive 
Federal research funding as Principal Investigator, and has published 
more than 90 refereed papers.

               der Hoek
             
             Associate Dean André van der Hoek has 
received a $500,000 National Science Foundation grant to research 
software design education, specifically to understand and innovate tool 
support, design exercises and course modules for sketch-based design 
practice and reflection.
             Van der Hoek's research will take an introspective look 
at the process by which a student or group of students arrive at a final
 software design. He hopes to delve into the alternatives students 
consider, as well as the thought processes students go through before 
arriving at a final product.  His project will observe actual software 
designers in 
               action and implement a tool for creative, sketch-based 
software design, and migrate to a studio-based approach to software 
design education.
             Through this research, van der Hoek hopes to enable 
students to gain a broader and deeper understanding of software design, 
and provide 
               instructors with an enhanced portfolio of teaching 
methods.
             Van der Hoek's research focuses on understanding and 
advancing the role of design, coordination, and education in software 
engineering. He has authored and co-authored over 80 peer-reviewed 
journal and conference publications, and in 2006 was a recipient of an 
ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award. He is a co-author of the 2005 
Configuration Management Impact Report as well as the 2007 Futures of 
Software Engineering Report on Software Design and Architecture.
             Van der Hoek was honored, in 2005, as UC Irvine 
Professor of the Year for his outstanding and innovative educational 
contributions.

             Computer Science Professors Michael Goodrich,
 Alfred Kobsa and Gene Tsudik have 
been awarded $300,000 by the National Science Foundation for research on
 Usable Location Privacy in Geo-Social Networks.
             The project will explore the usability, feasibility, and
 scalability of preserving privacy and securing location-aware 
geo-social networking platforms on mobile devices, such as Google 
Latitude. The research group is basing their project on a belief that 
security and privacy can best be incorporated with usability at the 
beginning of its design.
             The research will focus on the usability of 
privacy-agile secure location-based communication and supporting 
protocols that scale to large numbers of users and accommodate various 
privacy levels suitable for different application domains.
             This project envisions a wide range of future 
applications, with three unifying factors: (1) geo-social undertone, 
i.e., applications that combine social groups and locality, (2) lack of,
 or need to avoid using, fixed infrastructure facilities, and (3) need 
for both security and privacy.
             Goodrich's research is directed at the design of 
high-performance algorithms and data structures for solving large-scale 
problems surrounding the increased demands of computer graphics, 
information visualization, scientific data analysis, information 
assurance and security, and the Internet. He also is interested in 
computer science education, specifically ways of more effectively 
teaching data structures and algorithms.
             Kobsa's research lies in the areas of user modeling and 
personalized systems (with applications in the areas of information 
environments, expert finders, and user interfaces for disabled and 
elderly people), privacy, and in information visualization.
             Tsudik's research interests are mainly in 
computer/network security, privacy and applied cryptography. His recent 
work focuses on privacy in Internet services, RFID systems and mobile ad
 hoc networks, as well as security in sensor networks and storage 
systems. His research also covers secure group communication, in 
particular, group key agreement, group signatures and group access 
control.

Professor Jordan receives $500,000 NSF grant for Internet architecture and public policy integration
 
Scott
                   Jordan

Professor of Computer Science Scott Jordan has received a $500,000 National Science Foundation grant to incorporate telecommunications policy and economics into the Internet architecture. 
“As a result of technical, economic and public policy forces, the Internet's original design principles – layering and end-to-end – are increasingly violated,” says Jordan. 
Currently, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are deploying quality of service mechanisms, but only allowing their use for certain applications sold to their own subscribers. Some ISPs have used deep packet inspection techniques to implement traffic management practices that throttle or block peer-to-peer applications. 
Professor Jordan hopes to counteract this deterioration by proposing an interdisciplinary approach that updates the Internet architectural principles to account for telecommunications policy and economics. 
The project will identify the flaws of the end-to-end and layering models that are not withstanding the technical, economic, and legal forces upon networking.  The project aims to modify these models so that they promote good technical design, respond appropriately to economic pressures, and encourage societally beneficial outcomes. 
To validate these new models, Professor Jordan plans to illustrate their potential use by applying them to three case studies – net neutrality, traffic management, and Quality of Service.
Professor Jordan is also developing an undergraduate course on “The Internet and Public Policy”. This research will help bridge the gulf that exists between communication lawmakers and networking researchers by informing staff members in the United States Congress about the technical aspects of telecommunication issues, and by developing an architectural framework for the networking research community to help them consider impacts of network economics and law.
Professor Jordan’s research interests currently include pricing and differentiated services in the Internet, resource allocation in wireless multimedia networks, and telecommunications policy.

Tomlinson awarded NSF EAGER Grant to study interactive media for childhood environmental awareness
 
Bill
                   Tomlinson

Bill Tomlinson, professor of informatics, has been awarded a $280,371 Early-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) for his project which will utilize narrative-centered computing (NCC) to allow children to see how their own behavior can cause positive or negative changes in a story ecosystem.
Unlike traditional computational storytelling that utilizes a linear “filmstrip”, NCC framework begins with a new mechanism for computational storytelling called spatiotemporal anchoring. Spatiotemporally anchored stories consist of a network of story nodes in which each node depicts a small element of the overall plot, and is anchored to a specific location in space and time. 
To advance the story users explore a rich geographical representation of the relevant spatiotemporal locale, discovering story nodes and the interconnections between them. Because nodes can be anchored at variable levels of spatiotemporal resolution and interlinked in non-linear ways, exploring these narratives will help children to develop more nuanced abilities for reasoning about distributed causation and variable scale. These abilities, in turn, will translate into more effective engagement with environmental issues.
The EAGER program is intended to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches, therefore the grant will go toward funding the creation of a testbed interactive narrative, to be deployed online and as a temporary science museum exhibit. This narrative will use spatiotemporal anchoring along with video and traditional cinematographic techniques to dramatize the interactions that take place within a representative California ecosystem, for example, a marine environment in which sea otters, kelp forests, and sea urchins all interact. 
Tomlinson's research deals with the social impacts of information technologies, in particular regarding environmental issues and interactive education systems. His previous contributions to informatics and computer science are significant in human-computer interaction, interactive animation, autonomous agents, and multi-device systems.

Tomlinson received Environment Institute Grant, Support from Urban Water Research Center
 
BillTomlinson

Bill Tomlinson, Professor of Informatics, along with Professors Brett Sanders and Robin Keller have received a $38,000 grant from
                   the Environment Institute at UC Irvine to support a new project entitled “Using IT to Compress Perceived Time and Space in How People Think About
                   Global Change: A Step Towards Behavioral Change”. 
This interdisciplinary research collaboration is also being supported in part from a $10,000 contribution from the Urban Water Research Center at
                   UC Irvine.  Sanders and Keller are respectively professors at The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and The Paul Merage School of Business. 
The research collaboration will study the difficulties people have in engaging with environmental issues, in part because global change occurs on
                   scales of time and space that are relatively large compared to the usual scope of human decision making.   People respond enthusiastically to
                   fast-acting disasters such as fires and earthquakes, but less so to issues that occur more gradually over many years, even when the consequences
                   are far greater. 
To date, there has been little research on how to connect long-term global environmental change to human scales of time and space in a systematic
                   way, thereby enabling behavioral change.  Tomlinson et al’s research will focus on the science and public perception of sea level rise. 
Tomlinson's research deals with the social impacts of information technologies, in particular regarding environmental issues and interactive
                   education systems. His previous contributions to informatics and computer science are significant in human-computer interaction, interactive
                   animation, autonomous agents, and multi-device systems.

Olson gives keynote talks on Scientific Collaboration and Science Collaboratories
 
GaryOlson

Gary Olson, Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences will give two keynote talks at the University of Siegen in
                   Germany, and the 2009 International Symposium on Collaborative Technologies and Systems. 
Earlier this month, Olson gave a keynote entitled "Scientific Collaboration on the Internet", at the conference on Enhancing Humanities:
                   Potentials of Media and ICT in the Humanities, held at the University of Siegen in Germany. 
In 1989 a small group of pioneering thinkers, led by Joshua Lederberg and William Wulf, sketched out a vision of what has come to be known by
                   various names, such as collaboratories, eScience, and cyberscience. 
In the several decades since then many such projects have emerged in almost all areas of science.  But there has been a complex pattern of
                   success and failure in such efforts.  Olson and his colleagues have spent nearly a decade studying these projects, trying to figure out what
                   accounts for the pattern of success and failure in them. In his talk he reviewed lessons learned, and where he hopes to go with further research
                   in the area. 
The current understanding from this investigation was recently summarized in a book entitled "Scientific Collaboration on the Internet" (MIT
                   Press, 2008). 
This week in Baltimore, Olson will give a keynote entited "The Next Generation of Science Collaboratories". Olson will also talk about how the
                   changing technical scene opens new opportunities for the next generation of collaboratories, as well as the sociotechnical factors that
                   distinguish successful from unsuccessful collaboratories. 
Collaboratories to support scientific research have been around for at least two decades, and have emerged as an important form of
                   cyberinfrastructure to enable ever more ambitious geographically distributed research projects.  A broadened view of what a collaboratory is
                   suggests there are a variety of kinds of functions they could support. 
Early collaboratories were often rather narrow in focus, but some have broadened to mimic fully-functional laboratories.  Furthermore, will
                   almost all early collaboratories were in the physical and biological sciences, by now they have emerged as serious research infrastructure in
                   most domains, including the social sciences and humanities. 
Olson’s latest research focuses on how to support small groups of people working on difficult intellectual tasks, particularly when the members
                   of the group are geographically distributed.  This research has involved both field studies of groups attempting to do such work and lab studies
                   that evaluate specific technologies.  He is one of four Donald Bren Professors of Information and Computer Sciences at the Bren School.

                   University in Kaohsiung. 
The three-day workshop presentsed exemplars and strategies for doing qualitative field research in organizations. The activities of the workshop
                   were divided into three areas: 1) introducing the background and roles of qualitative methods in the research of workshop leaders and
                   participants; 2) introducing methodological issues and exercises in qualitative field research; and 3) discussion and feedback on workshop
                   participants’ qualitative research experiences and goals. 
Dourish's primary research interests are in the areas of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, Human-Computer Interaction, and Ubiquitous
                   Computing. He is especially interested in the foundational relationships between social scientific analysis and technological design.  More about
                   Dourish can be found on the Web.

Judy Olson gives talk on social ergonomics at CHI 2009
 
Judy
                  Olson

Judy Olson, Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences, gave the plenary opening at Computer-Human Interaction (CHI) 2009. Olson's talk, Even Small Distance Matters: Social Ergonomics in Collocated and Remote Teams, focused on the study of social ergonomics, the design of workplaces and systems that fit the natural social capabilities and inclinations of workers and users.
Olson reviewed some of the highlights of what is known about natural social capabilities and inclinations, showed how they play out in both “radically collocated” teamwork and remote teamwork before finishing with a set of guidelines for everyone to use when having to work either collocated or remotely.
CHI is the premier worldwide forum for exchanging information on all aspects of how people interact with computers. CHI 2009 ran from April 4-9, in Boston, MA offering two days of pre-conference workshops and four days of dynamic sessions that explored the future of computer-human interaction with researchers, practitioners, educators and students.
More than 2000 professionals from over 40 countries attended this year's conference, which marked 27 years of research, innovation and development of the Computer-Human Interaction community.
Olson has published about 110 peer-reviewed research articles and is best known for her work on distance collaborations and has achieved international acclaim for her studies that compared office workers in geographically distributed organizations to those working in the same location.

Tsudik to give keynote on secure device pairing at IPSEC 2009
 
Gene
                  Tsudik

Professor of Computer Science Gene Tsudik will be giving an invited keynote talk entitled "Secure and Usable Device Pairing" at the 5th Information Security Practice and Experience Conference (ISPEC 2009) to be held April 13-15, 2009, in Xi’an, China.
“Secure Device Pairing” is the process of bootstrapping a secure channel between two or more previously unassociated personal devices over a (usually wireless) human-imperceptible communication channel. Lack of prior security context and absence of common trust infrastructure open the door for so-called "Man-in-the-Middle" (or "Evil Twin") attacks. Mitigation of these attacks requires user involvement in the device pairing process.
Tsudik’s talk will summarize notable secure device pairing techniques, comparing and contrasting their advantages, shortcomings and limitations, followed by the first comprehensive and comparative evaluation of these methods.
ISPEC is an annual conference that brings together researchers and practitioners to provide a confluence of new information security technologies, their applications and their integration with IT systems in various vertical sectors.  More information about ISPEC can be found at the Conference Web site:  http://www.ispec2009.net/.
Tsudik's research interests are mainly in computer/network security, privacy and applied cryptography. His recent work focuses on privacy in Internet services, RFID systems and mobile ad hoc networks, as well as security in sensor networks and storage systems.
His research also covers secure group communication, in particular, group key agreement, group signatures and group access control. He also is interested in database security and public key cryptography.

Baldi awarded the Grant in Chemical Sciences to support development of Reaction Explorer
 
Pierre
                  Baldi

Chancellor's Professor Pierre Baldi has been awarded a grant in the Special Grant Program in Chemical Sciences by the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation.  
The grant is in support of the development of Reaction Explorer, a new interactive electronic tutorial system for teaching organic reactions, reaction mechanisms, organic synthesis and retrosynthesis at the undergraduate level.
Reaction Explorer is an interactive tutorial system for organic chemistry reactions, which enables students to learn about reactions in ways previously unrealized. 
With the Reaction Explorer project, Baldi, together with MD/PhD graduate student Jonathan Chen, aim to provide a richer learning experience including: dynamic generation of customized multi-step synthesis design problems; context-specific feedback messages; and support for inquiry-based learning through experimentation and interactive dialogue with the system.
Baldi’s research focuses in several areas of AI, data mining, machine learning, bioinformatics, and chemoinformatics. Projects in his group include understanding and predicting protein structures, analyzing and modeling gene expression data and regulatory networks, and building expert systems for chemistry and drug discovery.
The purpose of the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, Inc., is to advance the science of chemistry, chemical engineering and related sciences as a means of improving human relations and circumstances.
Established in 1946 by chemist, inventor and businessman Camille Dreyfus as a memorial to his brother Henry, the Foundation became a memorial to both men when Camille Dreyfus died in 1956. Throughout its history the Foundation has sought to take the lead in identifying and addressing needs and opportunities in the chemical sciences.

Li receives  NSF award  to study large-scale data cleaning
 
Chen
                  Li

Chen Li, associate professor of computer science, has
                  received an award for $221,730 from the NSF
                  CluE program to support his research on large-scale data cleaning
                using cloud computing. 
In addition, his team will also use software and services on a  Google-IBM cluster to explore innovative research ideas in data-intensive computing.
The project will study research challenges to support efficient data-cleaning queries on large text repositories using the MapReduce/Hadoop parallel computing paradigm.
Supporting such queries
                  is becoming increasingly more important in applications that need to deal with a variety of data inconsistencies in structures, representations, or semantics. 
The techniques developed in this
                  project will have a broad impact on many information systems that need to support approximate query processing on large data sets, such as Web search, enterprise search, data integration, and query relaxation.
Li's research interests are in the fields of database and information systems, including data integration and sharing, data warehouses, data cleansing, data privacy, and information management on the Web.

Carey awarded Google Research Award
 
Michael
                  Carey

Michael Carey, Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences, has been awarded a Google Research Award for $70,000 for his research entitled, “A Declarative and Open Source Data Mapping Tool for OpenII.”
Carey’s research is tackling the need for large organizations to effectively access and analyze data coming from disparate sources, including multiple databases, legacy information stores, applications and data stores published via Web services, XML files, and CSV files.
This project aims to produce a declarative and open source data-mapping tool for incorporation into the OpenII initiative. The Google OpenII initiative aims to enable such repositories to be put together much more easily than they can be today, creating better quality data that can then be (re)surfaced on the Web and made available to everyone.  Areas of potential impact include medical informatics, biology research, and access to many public data sets that are currently disparate.
Carey's research interests are in database systems, information integration, service-oriented computing, middleware, distributed systems, and computer system performance evaluation.
A National Academy of Engineering member, Carey is acknowledged as one of the 50 most influential computer scientists in the world. He is an ACM Fellow and in 2005, he received ACM’s SIGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations Award. 
He has also has earned two of the most esteemed research publication awards in the field: the Very Large Data Base (VLDB) Conference’s 10-Year Best Paper Award in 1996, and the 2004 Test of Time Paper Award at the ACM SIGMOD International Conference.
