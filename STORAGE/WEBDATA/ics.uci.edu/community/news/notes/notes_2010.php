WINTER 2011
Doctoral Student Named Microsoft Research Fellow

QiangLiu


Qiang Liu, a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science, has been awarded a prestigious 
Microsoft Research Fellowship 
for 2011-2013. Exceptionally competitive, the award seeks to recognize “the best and the brightest from North America.” Liu, whose research focuses primarily on problems in artificial intelligence, statistics and computational biology, was one of 12 recipients this year; 174 applied from a select list of departments that were invited to participate. The fellowship provides two years of support, including tuition, living expenses and a conference travel allowance. Fellows also are offered a summer internship opportunity at Microsoft Research.


Liu’s research, advised by Professor Alexander Ihler, works to develop efficient algorithms for learning and approximate reasoning in graphical models, which are used to describe large, complex systems in terms of smaller, more manageable local dependencies. Graphical models also have come to be used across a wide range of disciplines. 

 

Franz Wins Large DARPA Award

MichaelFranz


Michael Franz, UCI Computer Science Professor, has received a three-year $1.38 million award from DARPA’s Transformational Convergence Technology Office to investigate a new defense against software attacks. 
He is the sole PI of the project, which is inspired by biodiversity in nature and aims to create a similar diversity in the software that runs on the world’s computers. Currently, all users of a program download the exact same version of that program from a hosting site or an App Store. In Franz’s approach, the App Store will contain a diversification engine that will generate a unique version of every program for every user. This process will occur automatically inside of the AppStore, so that neither the software creators nor the users downloading it need to be aware of it.


From the end-user’s perspective, the different versions are indistinguishable and they all behave in exactly the same way, but internally, subtle differences make it impossible for an attacker to use the same attack for all the versions.


In order to make a large-scale attack successful, a perpetrator would have to launch many different attacks and would have no way of knowing which attack would succeed on which target. Equally important, this also makes it much more difficult to generate attack vectors by reverse-engineering security patches.


Franz leads the Secure Systems and Languages Laboratory at UC Irvine, one of the top research teams on dynamic compilation, virtual machines and language-based computer security. In collaboration with the Mozilla foundation, he transitioned the JavaScript compilation technology invented in his lab into the Firefox browser, where it is used every day by hundreds of millions of people.

 

Tomlinson Addresses Sustainability Conference

BillTomlinson


Bill Tomlinson, Informatics Associate Professor, delivered a plenary address last week in Washington, D.C. at a workshop that explored research challenges facing worldwide sustainability. 
Sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Computing Community Consortium, 
“The Role of Information Sciences and Engineering in Sustainability”
aimed to identify new research opportunities in the information sciences and engineering that address sustainability objectives.


Tomlinson’s talk, “IT and (Un)sustainable Cultures,” addressed core societal principles that he believes are the root causes of our greatest environmental concerns. Specifically, he said, industrialized civilizations’ emphases on growth and consumption are deeply unsustainable. 
Profound transformations in personal, institutional and infrastructure goals will be necessary to support a more sustainable existence and IT can play an important role in this evolution. 


He discussed the concept explored in his book, “Greening through IT,” that environmental issues occur on broad scales of time, space and complexity, but humans work best at narrower scales. “IT can help bridge this gap, enabling us to understand the complex chains of causality that underlie global climatic disruption, biodiversity loss, sea level rise and a host of other environmental issues,” he said. 
IT is also implicated in the creation of the world’s current environmental problems, he said, calling it a “force multiplier” that allows people to accomplish more and more. One way to approach these problems is to explore the ways in which IT can help alter unsustainable cultural norms and provide acceptable alternatives.


For example, he said, IT systems can help support local sustainable agriculture, public health, education and nutrition. They can provide social support and identity via social networking, virtualized workspaces and other support networks. These systems can also help people learn more about the world and how to live sustainably in it. 


“These are not new ideas,” he said. But in order to create necessary cultural change that can lead to increased sustainability, “we need more IT researchers to work on these projects.”

Tsudik is Keynote Speaker at Top Australasian Computer Science Event

GeneTsudik


Computer science professor Gene Tsudik delivered one of three keynote addresses last week in Perth, Australia, at the 2011 Australasian Computer Science Week conference – the region’s premier annual computer science event. 


His talk, “Usable Security: The Case of Secure Pairing of Wireless Devices,” focused on the process of creating an initial secure channel between multiple wireless devices that were previously unassociated, for example: two cell phones, a cell phone/Bluetooth combination, or an MP3 player and a wireless headset. Lack of a prior security context and absence of a global security infrastructure opens the door for so-called "man-in-the-middle" or “evil twin” attacks.


Tsudik summarized notable pairing techniques, comparing and contrasting their advantages and limitations. He evaluated these methods based on usability and security, and discussed methods best-suited for specific combinations of devices and human abilities. 


His talk also covered situations where more than two unfamiliar devices must be associated in order to ensure secure communications, and reported on a usability study that compares several such techniques. He concluded by highlighting still-unresolved issues and potential avenues for future research.


Tsudik, who serves as director of UCI’s Secure Computing and Networking Center (SCONCE) and vice-chair of ICS’s Department of Computer Science, is also editor-in-chief of the ACM “Transactions on Information and Systems Security.” His research interests include computer/network security and privacy, and applied cryptography.

 

DECEMBER 2010
Majumder Delivers ISVC Keynote

AditiMajumder


Aditi Majumder, Computer Science Associate Professor, was a keynote speaker at the 
International Symposium on Visual Computing 
2010, a prestigious graphics and vision conference that brings together renowned researchers from all over the world.


Majumder’s talk, “Ubiquitous Displays: A Distributed Network of Active Displays,” presents her team’s work-in-progress on developing a new display paradigm in which displays are not mere carriers of information, but active members of the workspace — interacting with data, user, environment and other displays. The goal is to integrate such active displays seamlessly with the environment, making them ubiquitous to multiple users and data.


Majumder’s research aims to make multi-projector displays truly commodity products and easily accessible to the common man. Her significant research contributions include photometric and color registration across multi-projector displays, enabling use of imperfect projectors in tiled displays, and more recently a distributed framework for tiled displays via a distributed network of projector-camera pairs. A 2009 recipient of the NSF CAREER award, she has played a key role in developing the first curved screen multi-projector display being marketed by NEC/Alienware and is an advisor at Disney Imagineering for advances in their projection-based theme park rides.

OCTOBER 2010
UC Irvine Computer Scientists awarded an NIH grant to develop novel search methods for searching biomedical literature

ChenLi


XiaohuiXie


Computer science professors Chen Li and Xiaohui Xie have been awarded a $371,000 two-year grant from the National Institute of Health to develop novel search methods for mining biomedical literature.


The MEDLINE database, complied by the United States National Library of Medicine, is a comprehensive bibliographic database of life sciences and biomedical information. The database contains more than 19 million records from approximately 5,000 selected publications, covering much of the literature in biomedicine and health.  The database is also growing fast, with thousands of updates every day.


Searching MEDLINE has become an indispensable component in the daily life of medical practitioners, biological researchers, and an increasing number of patients who prefer to seek medical information through their own hands.


Currently, searching MEDLINE is primarily conducted through the PubMed web server, maintained by National Center for Biotechnology Information of NIH, which handles millions of searches per day. Given the high popularity and importance, it is critical to study how to make MEDLINE search more powerful and easier to use.


Li and Xie, together with collaborators at Tsinghua University, China, have developed a system called iPubMed, to study how to support instant, error-tolerant search on MEDLINE publications.


Their published paper in the journal Bioinformatics demonstrated that the experience of searching MEDLINE can be significantly improved by instant search.


In the new search paradigm, a user can view the search results instantly as he or she types each letter of the query. Because the user can modify the query on the fly according to the instantly returned results, it can take much less time for them to locate the right items.


This new search model is also gaining popularity in other domains. For instance, Google recently released a new web search tool called Google Instant, which implements the similar idea. The error-tolerant feature is especially important when the user does not remember the exact spelling of the keywords, such as a disease name or an author name.


The NIH grant will support Professors Li and Xie’s research efforts to further improve the iPubMed system.


Li's research interests are in the fields of database and information systems, including Web search, large-scale data management, data cleansing, and data integration.


Xie's research focuses in machine learning, bioinformatics, computational biology and neural computation. He is interested in both developing novel machine learning theory and algorithms, and applying them to practical problems, such as biology and medical science.

 

SEPTEMBER 2010
Dechter et al place first in the 2010 UAI Challenge

RinaDechter


Computer science professor Rina Dechter, with her students, has won first place in the 2010 Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) Approximate Inference Challenge.  The UAI community is focused on developing algorithms for answering queries over knowledge-bases known as "graphical models" that represent both certain and uncertain information about the world.

For example, the algorithms can express the information that if an individual is a smoker, their chances for developing cancer are higher than someonw who is  a non-smoker. Given such statements with numerous additional such rules with and without numerical probabilities, which involve numbers in a particular domain such as medicine, researchers want to answer a variety of questions.
“When we get ‘evidence’ or observations, we want to know how they change our ‘belief’ about certain other facts,” says Dechter.  
“The evidence in the example is ‘Peter is smoking’, and I want to know the probability that ‘Peter has cancer.’  Or, I can have evidence that ‘Peter has cancer’ and the question I am interested in is what is the probability that ‘Peter smokes.’”
Overall, when there is a probabilistic graphical model describing some world – such as the medical domain in the example above – and evidence on specific individual conditions, computer scientist often attempt to compute such answers.
The UAI challenge is third in a series of events that challenge the UAI community to provide their code for approximation algorithms so that  they   all work on  the same set of problems and run on the same machines. The results are then announced.
In the UAI 2010 challenge Dechter and her team compared algorithms on each of three tasks, and for 3 different lengths of time, comparing the accuracy of their results against actual results.
Of the nine competing teams, Dechter with  Vibhav Gogate (currently a postdoctoral student at university of Washington)   were placed first on the  two tasks and (with  Lars Otten) placed third place on the third task.
Professor Dechter's research centers on computational aspects of automated reasoning and knowledge representation including search, constraint processing and probabilistic reasoning. The primary aim of her research is to devise efficient methods through the understanding and exploitation of tractable reasoning tasks.
Professor Dechter is an author of the book "Constraint Processing" published by Morgan Kaufmann, 2003, and has authored over 100 research papers. 
 

Olsons awarded $400,000 for study on distributed collaborations

GaryOlson


JudyOlson


Gary and Judy Olson, Bren Professors in Information and Computer Sciences, have been awarded $400,000 for their research entitled “Next Steps in Articulating Success Factors for Distributed Collaborations.”


The Olsons have spent the past decade studying work at a distance, both in science and engineering venues as well as in corporations.  During this time, they have identified the major the factors that make for success in work at a distance.  From these, the Olsons have developed a preliminary theory, called the Theory of Remote Scientific Collaboration (TORSC), published in 2008.


Given this theory, the Olsons have developed an online assessment device called the Collaboration Success Wizard, which goes through each of the important factors in question form and either confirms that the collaboratory has a good chance of success or suggests a remedy for the factors that are not met. 


These assessments and data collected from the tool will be directed at deepening the understanding of what differentiates successful from unsuccessful distributed collaborations, and provide guidance to those who are developing such collaborations.


Gary and Judy Olson expect that their research will have major implications for the emergence of successful virtual organizations to facilitate distance collaborations, in science and beyond.


Gary Olson, author of more than 120 published research articles, has dedicated his work to understanding how technology can support remote collaboration. He also has made important contributions to the studies of management practice and the cultural aspects of collaboration, as well as the complex socio-technical issues surrounding technology design.


Judy Olson has published about 110 published research articles and is best known for her work on distance collaborations and has achieved international acclaim for her studies that compared office workers in geographically distributed organizations to those working in the same location.


They are both Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery, and were jointly awarded the ACM SIGCHI Lifetime Achievement Award.

Jain receives SIGMM Technical Achievement Award

RameshJain


Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences Ramesh Jain has received ACM’s Special Interest Group on Multimedia (SIGMM) Technical Achievement award.


The award, given in recognition of outstanding contributions over a researcher’s career, cited Jain’s “pioneering research and inspiring leadership that transformed multimedia information processing to enhance the quality of life and visionary leadership of the multimedia community”.


The SIGMM award will be presented at the ACM International Conference on Multimedia 2010 that will be held October 25-29, 2010 in Florence, Italy.


Jain has made pioneering contributions in the areas of multimedia information systems, image databases, machine vision, and intelligent systems for more than three decades.  His early work on accumulative difference pictures established the dynamic vision field that has directly influenced today’s digital video processing. Many techniques such as background subtraction, tracking, and event detection were first introduced in his pioneering papers in this field. 


In 1992, Jain proposed and organized the inaugural NSF workshop on visual information management systems that established a new research direction leading to the enormous advances that we see today in content-based analysis and search of images and video. Jain has pioneered techniques that analyze content and combine information from multiple sources.


His emphasis in recent years on event-based representation and analysis of multimedia data has led the community’s focus to be on live dynamic data. In fact, he has recently pioneered the first comprehensive multimedia Event model which is increasingly being adopted.


Professor Jain's research has also impacted society through his active entrepreneurship, having founded five companies producing software and services in the area of image processing, visual media retrieval and multimedia experience management on the mobile platform. 

 

Stern, Yu receive $620,000 NSF grant for study in stastistical methods for climate systems

HalStern


YamingYu


Statistics professors Hal Stern and Yaming Yu, along with professor of earth systems science, Gudrun Magnusdottir, received a $620,000 3-year grant from the National Science Foundation to develop novel statistical methods for the analysis for climate systems and their interactions.


The award from the Collaboration in Mathematical Geosciences program will support the interdisciplinary work of a team that includes the faculty and graduate students from the two departments. The traditional approach to studying climate systems combines data from long periods of time assuming that the location of the systems is consistent over time.  The proposed new approach would allow for the position of systems to vary smoothly over time.


Hal Stern is Ted and Janice Smith Family Foundation Dean. His research interests include: statistical inference using Bayesian methods, assessing the fit of statistical models, applications of statistics in health sciences and in the physical sciences. 


Yu's research interests include statistical methods for missing data problems and statistical computing algorithms.

 


Welling wins Koenderink Prize at European Conference on Computer Vision


MaxWelling


Max Welling, professor of computer science, has been awarded European Conference on Computer Vision’s Koenderink Prize in recognition of his computer vision research paper that has “withstood the test of time.” Entitled “Unsupervised Learning of Models for Recognition,” the paper was originally published in 2000.


The research paper presents a method to learn object class models from unlabeled and unsegmented cluttered scenes for the purpose of visual object recognition. The authors focused on a particular type of model where objects are represented as ﬂexible constellations of rigid parts (features):


“The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and the output of part detectors. In a ﬁrst stage, the method automatically identiﬁes distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classiﬁcation results on human faces and rear views of cars.”


Professor Welling's research lies in the areas of machine learning and machine vision with links to closely related areas such as pattern recognition, data mining, computational statistics, and large-scale data analysis.

Lilly Irani wins Best Paper Award at ACM ICIC

LillyIrani


Informatics Ph.D. Student Lilly Irani, along with Professors Paul Dourish and Melissa Mazmanian, have been awarded the Best Paper Award at the first ACM International Conference on Intercultural Collaboration. 


The paper, entitled “Shopping for Sharpies in Seattle: Mundane Infrastructures of Transnational Design,” describes the importance of mundane tools for design practitioners in India who are working with Euro-American clients.  The published findings are based on an ongoing ethnographic study of a design firm based in Delhi, India.

 
The research team analyzed everyday tools such as post-its as infrastructures with both practical and symbolic functions. These infrastructures are made meaningful in the shared practices of a transnational but primarily Euro- American design community. Material infrastructures shape the design processes and design communication as the teams work to established effective collaborations.


Irani’s research interests lie in the areas of political economy, globalization issues in technoculture, development, and critical innovation studies.

Tsudik awarded $600,000 in NSF effort to re-design the Internet


GeneTsudik


Gene Tsudik, professor of computer science, has been awarded $600,000 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) as part of  the Named Data Networking (NDN) project in the NSF Future Internet Architecture (FIA) program.  The goal of  FIA is to design a more effective, trustworthy and robust Internet protocols and techniques.


Led by Professor Lixia Zhang of UCLA, the NDN project will focus on Internet architecture that moves the communication paradigm from today's focus on "where" (i.e., Internet addresses, servers, and hosts), to "what" (i.e., content that  users and applications care about).


Current Internet communication is based on a client-server model of interaction: communicating parties establish  a relationship and then proceed to transfer information contained within IP packets transported along one or more paths. However, the most predominant use of the Internet is actually centered on content creation, dissemination and delivery,  and this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. While the basic client-server model has enabled a wide range of services and applications, it does not offer adequate mechanisms to support secure content-oriented functionality,  regardless of the specific physical location where the content resides.


By naming data instead of its location (IP address), NDN transforms data into a first-class entity.  While the current Internet mainly secures the channel between communication points, NDN secures the content and provides essential context for security. NDN allows the decoupling of trust  in data from trust in hosts and servers, enabling trustworthiness as well as several very scalable  communication mechanisms, for example, automatic caching to optimize bandwidth and the  potential to move content along multiple paths to the destination.


This goal of this project is to address technical challenges in creating NDN, including: routing scalability,  fast forwarding, trust models, network security, content protection and privacy, as well as new  fundamental communication theory.


UC Irvine will focus specifically on security and privacy aspects of the NDN architecture. Besides UCLA, other collaborating institutions include: PARC, Yale, Washington University and Colorado State.


Gene Tsudik's research interests include computer/network security, privacy and applied cryptography.  His recent work focuses on privacy in Internet services, RFID systems, mobile ad hoc networks, as well as  security in sensor networks and storage systems.

                   Javanmardi places third in an international competition for detecting vandalism in Wikipedia

                   
SaraJavanmardi

Sara Javanmardi, a Ph.D. student in Informatics, has placed third in an international competition for detecting vandalism in Wikipedia. 
Vandalism has always been one of Wikipedia's biggest problems, yet there are only few automatic countermeasures. Instead, volunteers spend their time in reverting vandalism edits — time, which is not spend on improving other parts of the Wikipedia. The goal of the evaluation campaign was to research and develop new, reliable ways to detect vandalism edits, which can be used to aid Wikipedia. 
Sponsored by Yahoo! Research, the competition is part of the fourth International Workshop on Uncovering Plagiarism, Authorship, and Social Software Misuse PAN-10 will be held as an evaluation lab in conjunction with the Conference on Multilingual and Multimodal Information Access Evaluation in Padua, Italy. 
Javanmardi's current research, in collaboration with Professor Cristina Lopes, focuses on social media content analysis. Her goal is to develop general quality-analysis and real-time search solutions that will be extendable to other Web 2.0 (social media) applications such as Twitter, Digg and blogs.

                   Franz receives Academic Senate’s top research award

                   
MichaelFranz

Computer science professor Michael Franz has been named the recipient of the 2010-11 Academic Senate Distinguished Award for Mid-Career Research — the Academic Senate’s highest honor for excellence in research.

Professor Franz, along with former graduate student Andreas Gal, is the inventor of Trace Compilation, a radically new way of building just-in-time compilers.  This technique is widely regarded as the single biggest invention in compilers in 20 years.  His research impact currently extends to 500 million people globally using software that integrates his technique, such as Mozilla’s Firefox browser.  In addition, Franz’s research has enabled third world countries to connect using no-cost cloud software such as Gmail and Google Docs, thereby closing the gap in the “digital divide”. 
Franz’s invention is a radical departure from the long-established convention of  “control flow graph”, a technique used for over five decades to model a program’s control flow that a compiler builds and then traverses while generating code.  Instead of constructing a control-flow graph of the program, Franz’s patent-pending technique called Trace Tree utilizes an intermediate representation that is constructed on-demand while the program is simultaneously executed, incrementally compiled and optimized. 
The advantage of the Trace Tree technique is that it utilizes one-seventh (1/7) of the memory footprint and one-thirtieth (1/30) of the compile time of traditional compilers.  Working with the Mozilla foundation, Franz has incorporated this technique into the Firefox browser, beginning with version 3.5.  By incorporating the Trace Tree, Mozilla was able to raise Firefox’s JavaScript performance 700%. 
Franz is currently in collaboration with Adobe to incorporate his just-in-time compiler into their next version of Flash.  In addition, Google’s Android team has adopted Trace Compilation for the next generation smart phone operating system.  These integrations coupled with the Firefox deployment will result in the impact of potentially several billion devices. 
Professor Franz is director at UC Irvine’s Secure Systems and Software Laboratory. A Distinguished Scientist of the Association for Computing Machinery and a Senior Member of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Franz has graduated 13 Ph.D. students, been awarded more than $7 Million in competitive Federal research funding as Principal Investigator, and has published more than 90 refereed papers. 
The Academic Senate's Distinguished Faculty awards are selected by the Committee on Scholarly Honors and Awards.

                   Vernica named Yahoo! Key Scientific Challenges winner

                   
RaresVernica

Rares
 Vernica,  a PhD student in computer science, has been 
named one of the winners of the
                   2010 Yahoo! Key Scientific Challenges Program, 
sponsored by Yahoo! Inc. for his work on "Efficient Similarity-Based
                   Operators for Social Data." He was nominated by 
professors Michael J. Carey and Prof. Chen Li. 
Vernica will take a look at social networking sites 
to explore how an extremely large social graph can be
                   efficiently analyzed for the purposes of information 
retrieval/recommendation and social trend detection. 
"The increasing popularity of social networking sites
 like Facebook and MySpace has led to the emergent trend of
                   increasing integration between content and social 
sites," says Vernica. 
"In one direction, social sites are adding more and 
more content — such as photo, video, and news articles
                   — to their sites to provide more practical utility to
 their users. Conversly, content sites like Amazon and
                   Yahoo! Travel are incorporating social activities and
 connections to more deeply engage their users." 
With the establishment of the OpenSocial 
(opensocial.org) Foundation, the integration of social sites and content
                   sites will likely be one of the major trends in the 
next few years. 
The Yahoo! Key Scientific Challenges Program 
encourages top graduate students globally to collaborate with Yahoo!
                   and help invent the future of the Internet. The 
program focuses on a variety of scientific issues, from developing
                   algorithms that turn raw information into personally 
relevant experiences, to discovering insights about online
                   advertising and experimenting with new sociological 
models for how people engage with the Web. More about the
                   program can be found here.

NithyaSambasivan

Nithya Sambasivan, graduate student 
in informatics, and Professor Bonnie Nardi
                   received a a Best Paper nomination at the CHI 
Conference 2010. Entitled, “Intermediated Technology Use in
                   Developing Communities,” the paper is published in 
the Proceedings of  the ACM Conference on Human Factors
                   in Computer Systems. 
The paper describes a prevalent mode of information 
access in low-income communities of the developing world—
                   intermediated interactions. The research takes an 
ethnographic look of two urban slums of Bangalore, India, studying
                   how digitally skilled users can enable persons for 
whom technology is inaccessible due to non-literacy, lack of
                   technology-operation skills, or financial 
constraints. 
The paper presents some requirements and challenges 
in interface design of these interactions and explains how they
                   are different from direct interactions. They go on to
 explain the broader effects of these interactions on low-income
                   communities, and present implications for design. 
Nithya Sambasivan is interested in human-centered 
technologies towards socio-economic betterment. She is also
                   interested in mobile and ubiquitous computing as 
vehicles of social change. 
Professor Nardi's research interests include theory 
in human-computer interaction and computer-supported
                   collaborative work and studies of social life on the 
Internet. Her current work concerns World of Warcraft and
                   online crafting communities such as Ravelry. 


                   El Zarki, Lopes, Scacchi proposals win new initiative
 grants

                   
MagdaEl Zarki


                   
CristaLopes

A program to train scientists to better manage vast, 
complex datasets, and a center that will
                   transform human mobility through information 
technology and robotics, have been selected as the
                   first recipients of the Large-Scale Interdisciplinary
 Research Ignition Initiative sponsored by
                   Calit2, The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and 
the Donald Bren School of Information and
                   Computer Sciences. 
The funding program, announced last December, aims to
 promote interdisciplinary research that
                   will evolve into large-scale, agency-funded projects 
or centers in the areas of health, energy,
                   environment, information, communications or digital 
technologies. 
The selection committee, comprised of deans Debra 
Richardson and Rafael Bras, and Calit2 Irvine
                   director G.P. Li, chose the iScience project and 
iMove Center based on their multidisciplinary
                   nature, likelihood of attracting significant funding 
from outside agencies, innovation,
                   scientific value and long-term impact. 
iScience seeks to address the escalating volume of 
data collected by natural scientists, who
                   increasingly are stymied by the sheer size of the 
datasets. Data-driven computing faces
                   challenges in storing and managing these large, 
complex distributed and dynamic data collections,
                   and needs radically new tool sets and visualization 
schemes to effectively explore, mine,
                   understand and extract new knowledge from the 
information. 
Project PI Magda El Zarki 
(information and computer science) and co-PI
                   Crista Lopes (informatics) propose a
 program to educate students, along with
                   their faculty, across disciplines to create a new 
crop of scientists who are knowledgeable in
                   the basic concepts of natural and computational 
sciences. 
The iMove Center, led by co-PIs David Reinkensmeyer 
(mechanical and aerospace engineering, and
                   biomedical engineering), Steve Cramer (neurology), 
Mark Bachman (electrical engineering and
                   computer science) and Walt Scacchi 
(information and computer science) will
                   search for ways to use information technology, 
robotics and neuro-regenerative therapies,
                   including dance, sport and computer games, to improve
 human mobility and challenge patients
                   beyond what is possible with current rehabilitation 
models. 
Researchers hope to help shape new brain circuits and
 assess movement recovery with novel
                   electrophysiological, functional imaging and 
behavioral outcome measures. The center also seeks
                   to produce technologies useful to those without 
disabilities, including innovative, interactive
                   training and performance technologies for sport and 
dance. 
Each winning project will receive grants totaling 
$40,000: $20,000 now and $20,000 when a
                   proposal is submitted to an outside agency requesting
 a minimum of $500,000 per year for at
                   least 3 years.  Additional calls for proposals for 
the initiative will occur in October 2010 and
                   February 2011. 
"We are pleased to be a part of this new 
multidisciplinary initiative that will ultimately
                   benefit society," said Calit2's Li, "and we look 
forward to the long-term success of our first
                   two recipient projects." 


                   Mehrotra, Hore receive NEC Research Award

                   
SharadMehrotra

Professor Sharad Mehrotra and 
postdoctoral student Bijit Hore
                   have received a $60,000 NEC Research Award  to study 
Risk Containment in Cloud Computing Services
                   for Data centric Applications. 
Building upon the pioneering work by Mehrotra's group on privacy 
challenges in data outsourcing
				   (also known as the database as a service model), the  goal of 
this study is to understand
				   information disclosure risks and design mechanisms to prevent 
disclosure in multi-tenant cloud
				   environments and  dynamic data integration applications such as 
mashups. 
As cloud computing becomes prevalent for enterprise data 
management, increasingly privacy
				   sensitive user data will be managed in such systems. 
In addition, the project will  address how one can reduce the 
risk of memory based leakage of
				   critically sensitive information in the Mapreduce framework. The 
Mapreduce framework provides a
				   highly scalable and robust approach for large data processing 
applications in a cloud-computing

                   Majumder and Sajadi win Best Paper award at IEEE 
Virtual Reality 2010

Computer Science Professor Aditi Majumder
 and graduate student Behzad Sajadi
                   have received the Best Paper Award at the IEEE 
Virtual Reality 2010 conference held in Boston. 
The paper, entitled "Auto-Calibration of Cylindrical 
Multi-Projector Systems," explores registering
                   multiple projectors on vertically extruded a 
cylindrical display, which previously was only possible with
                   a calibrated stereo camera. 
This papers shows that using some simple priors, one 
can achieve multiple projector registration on a
                   cylindrical display using a single uncalibrated 
camera without any markers on the display.  More
                   importantly, the new method enables use of multiple 
overlapped projectors across corners of a vertically
                   extruded surface with sharp edges. This is of 
tremendous benefit to virtual reality display systems like
                   CAVEs, that avoided mounting projectors across the 
corners until today.

Professor Majumder's research addresses how to 
produce a seamless image on a large-scale tiled display
                   - an important problem to both the scientific and 
entertainment fields. Majumder has developed a suite of
                   mathematical models, methods and software to correct 
the geometric, chromatic and luminescent variations
                   that arise when tiling multiple projection displays.

Informatics graduate student Lilly Irani
 spoke on March 3 at a Commonwealth Club panel
                   in San Fancisco. The panel brought together people 
from business, NGOs, and research to discuss the ethics
                   and possibilities of crowdsourcing platforms such as 
Mechanical Turk, Crowdflower, and Samasource. 

 



 
MARCH 2010

                   Li receives NSF grant to support Family Reunification
 project

                   
ChenLi

Professor of Computer Science Chen Li
 has received a $50,000 NSF grant for his project entitled "RAPID:
                   Supporting Family Reunification for the Haiti 
Earthquake and Future Emergencies." 
Li has been leading an effort on a website for family
 reunification for the Haiti earthquake
                   (http://fr.ics.uci.edu/haiti/).
 In addition to crawling and scraping data from
                   Web pages for the Google-hosted repository at
                   http://haiticrisis.appspot.com/,
 the team also built a powerful search interface
                   on the data. 
During this effort, the team has identified several 
interesting technical challenges that Li will study in this proposal. 
The
                   research will focus on how to support powerful search
 in a could-computing environment, such as Google App Engine. The 
techniques
                   developed in this project will have a broad impact on
 many information systems that are moving to the cloud-computing 
paradigm.
                   The team will use the Google Person Finder project as
 a real application to test the techniques, and could provide the 
techniques
                   and source code to be used in family reunification 
during future disasters. 
Li's research interests are in the fields of database
 and information systems, including data integration, data cleaning, Web
                   search, and large-scale information processing using 
parallel computing.

                   Newman awarded NSF EAGER to analyze grant portfolios

                   
DavidNewman

Research Scientist David Newman has 
been awarded a $25,000 NSF EAGER Award for his research entitled 
"Analyzing
                   Grant Portfolios through Topic Modeling."  The goal 
of this research is to develop and apply topic models — Bayesian models
                   for document collections — to model and analyze 
collections of grant proposals and their metadata (funding amount, NSF
                   Directorate, NSF Program, etc.). 
The award will be used to develop and demonstrate 
tools to help NSF program officers better analyze, visualize and 
interact with
                   large collections of both unfunded proposals and 
funded projects.  This will both help streamline the grant proposal 
review and
                   decision process, and help NSF understand what areas 
of research could use more funding, or are under-represented. 
Newman's current research focuses on theory and 
application of topic models and related text mining techniques.  His 
research is
                   marked by a commitment to combining theoretical 
advances with practical applications in ways that widen access and use 
for
                   individuals and communities, and ultimately improve 
the way people find and discover information. 

 
FEBRUARY 2010

                   Mehrotra awarded Google Research Award to improve 
data quality

                   
SharadMehrotra

Professor Sharad Mehrotra and 
Assistant Adjunct Professor Dmitri V. Kalashnikov have 
been awarded
                   a Google Research Award for $50,000 for a research 
effort entitled "Exploiting Entity Resolution for Web People Search." 
The goal of this research is to explore a novel 
graphical domain-independent framework that exploits semantics of 
various forms to
                   improve data quality. Data quality challenge is 
ubiquitous in various domains - it arises whenever we collect and create
 large
                   repositories of information, especially when 
information is captured and assimilated automatically. 
The award will be used to develop an adaptive 
self-tuning entity resolution framework which will be used to build an 
online search
                   engine that can disambiguate amongst namesakes on the
 Web. The system will exploit web queries and search engine statistics 
for
                   disambiguation. 
Mehrotra's current research focuses on next 
generation database management systems that provide natural and 
efficient support for
                   complex multidimensional data sets. Multidimensional 
data sets abound in numerous application domains in which database 
technology
                   is currently being deployed. For example, medical 
information systems require databases to provide native support for 
X-rays,
                   volumetric MRI scans, and time varying volumetric 
information.
