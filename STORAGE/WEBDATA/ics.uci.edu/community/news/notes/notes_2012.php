Assembling complete individual genomes: Xie, Li awarded $662K NIH grant

XiaohuiXie


ChenLi


Computer science faculty Xiaohui Xie and Chen Li have been awarded a three-year grant of nearly $662,000 from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop new computational tools essential for future advances in sequencing human genomes.


DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research, understanding disease mechanisms and the development of new, increasingly personalized treatments. Current sequencing of an individual’s genome is done by extracting short segments of DNA, randomly sampling those segments and then assembling the hundreds of millions, or even hundreds of billions, of pieces into a whole genome, which remains a costly undertaking. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, which enable the rapid generation of billions of bases of genes at relatively low cost, pose a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. 


“Although a number of computational tools have been developed to address this problem, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes,” says Xie. 


The primary goal of his NIH-funded research is to develop computational algorithms and open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of NGS analysis tools and expand the accessibility of those tools to previously understudied regions. This will create a new way of mapping the sequencing to the reference genome, identifying all mapping locations instead of one or only a few. That will be followed by a machine-learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads.


UCI computer scientists on the project are collaborating with biologists developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems, including Timothy Osborne of Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, Kyoko Yokomori of the UCI School of Medicine and Ken Cho of UCI’s School of Biological Sciences. 


The UCI team’s work to reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of sequencing ultimately may make it possible to create an individual patient’s genome as part of a routine diagnostic procedure. 

 





Meenakshisundaram, Mukherjee receive best paper award at ICVGIP 2012


      
 Gopi  Meenakshisundaram 



 Uddipan  Mukherjee 


“Tweening Boundary Curves of Non-Simple Immersions of a Disk,” by associate professor of computer science 
Gopi Meenakshisundaram 
and Ph.D. student 
Uddipan Mukherjee, 
won the sole best paper award at the eighth Indian Conference of Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing (ICVGIP) held in Mumbai, India. 


Tweening, also known as shape morphing, is an important concept in keyframe animation wherein an initial shape is transformed smoothly into a final shape. The paper introduces a robust tweening algorithm capable of creating smooth transformations between non-simple polygonal shapes that are immersions of a disk. All the intermediate shapes that are generated by the authors’ algorithm are guaranteed to be disk immersions.


Both Meenakshisundaram and Mukherjee are members of UC Irvine’s Interactive Graphics and Visualization lab, also known as iGravi. Meenakshisundaram’s research focuses primarily on topics related to geometry and topology motivated by problems in computer graphics and interactive rendering, medical and biological image processing and visualization. Mukherjee’s research interests include computer graphics, geometry processing, image processing and multimedia.

 






Enhancing privacy in embedded systems: Tsudik receives grant from Bosch

 Gene  Tsudik 


Bosch Research and Technology Center has awarded computer science professor 
Gene Tsudik 
$50,000 to support his efforts to enhance privacy in embedded systems. This grant represents the first partnership between Bosch and UC Irvine.


The term “embedded systems” refers to systems that control specific functions within a larger structure. Embedded systems help control everything from pacemakers, security systems and cell phones to planes, trains and automobiles. Used by the billions in countless applications, these systems have become essential to daily life. As long as they operate safely and effectively, most of us never even think about them.


Tsudik, who also directs the Secure Computing and Networking Center (SCONCE) at UCI, continuously explores ways to increase the security of such systems. Bosch Research and Technology Center — the research arm of one of the world’s leading manufacturers of appliances, automotive components, security systems, medical equipment and many other devices dependent on embedded systems — sought Tsudik’s collaboration in research on embedded systems security.


As more devices use embedded systems, and as these systems increasingly communicate with other equipment, privacy becomes even more challenging and essential. “Communication between embedded systems is like opening a new door,” Tsudik observes. “Once that door is open, you never know who — or what — might come in.”


Through his collaboration with Bosch and his ongoing research, Tsudik seeks to improve security and to maintain integrity of embedded devices in the most efficient manner. 

 






Li, Mehrotra receive DASFAA 10-year Best Paper Award

Chen  Li


SharadMehrotra 


Computer science professors Chen Li and Sharad Mehrotra have won the 2013 DASFAA 10-year Best Paper Award, to be presented by the Database Systems for Advanced Applications at its 18th international conference. The award recognizes the best paper from DASFAA proceedings 10 years prior, based on the criterion that the paper has had the biggest impact (research, products, methodology) over the last decade. 


Li and Mehrotra’s 2003 paper, “Efficient Record Linkage in Large Data Sets,” co-authored with Liang Jin (M.S. ’03) describes an efficient and accurate approach to record linkage.


The annual DASFAA international database conference provides a forum for technical presentations and discussions among database researchers, developers and users from academia, business and industry. DASFAA 2013 will be held April in Wuhan, China.


Mehrotra’s current research focuses on building sentient spaces using multimodal sensors, data privacy and data quality. Li’s research interests are in the fields of databases and information retrieval, including search, data-intensive computing, data integration and sharing, data warehouses, data cleansing, and Web information management. 


In 2012, Li and Mehrotra won the SIGMOD Test-of-Time Award for their paper, “Executing SQL over Encrypted Data in the Database-Service-Provider Model.” The paper was co-authored by Hakan Hacigumus (M.S. ’02, Ph.D. ’04) and IBM collaborator Bala Iyer. 

 










NSF awards $500K grant to Welling, Shahbaba

MaxWelling


BabakShahbaba


The National Science Foundation has awarded computer science professor Max Welling and assistant professor of statistics Babak Shahbaba $500,000 to fund the project "Efficient Bayesian Learning from Stochastic Gradients." 


Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a technique that allows one to draw representative samples from almost any probability distribution. While the MCMC technology has revolutionized the usefulness of Bayesian statistics over the last few decades, it has not been able to scale well to today’s very large data problems. Welling and Shahbaba will examine a new family of MCMC procedures that requires only a few hundred data-cases per update. 


"We believe this new class of methods will for the first time unlock the full strength of Bayesian methods for very large datasets," stated Welling and Shahbaba in their NSF proposal. "Due to their highly practical nature, the techniques developed under this grant are likely to gain widespread acceptance across a broad spectrum of academic disciplines as well as in industry."


The grant will enable UC Irvine students to collaborate with students and postdocs from the University of Oxford and the University of Bristol. Research results will be integrated into artificial intelligence and machine learning courses at UCI through class projects.

Eppstein receives GD2012 best paper award 



“Planar Lombardi Drawings for Subcubic Graphs,” authored by computer science professor David Eppstein, has recieved the best paper award in the combinatorial and algorithmic aspects track of the 
20th International Symposium on Graph Drawing. 


Lombardi drawing is a style of information visualization inspired by the art of Mark Lombardi, who drew social networks in which the nodes and edges represent the players and financial connections in international conspiracies — using a style characterized by curved edges and even node spacing. Eppstein’s 
paper 
uses circle packings and hyperbolic geometry to show how to construct Lombardi drawings for every planar graph that has, at most, three edges per node. 


Eppstein’s research focuses on many topics in computational geometry and graph algorithms, including: graph drawing and information visualization; dynamic graph algorithms and dynamic closest pair data structures; and mesh generation and optimal triangulation.

 






Securing the Internet’s next generation: Tsudik receives $95K from Cisco 

 Gene  Tsudik 


Cisco Systems has awarded $95,000 to help support the work of computer science professor Gene Tsudik in making the next-generation Internet more secure. An expert in computer security and privacy, Tsudik leads a team that is exploring security advantages and strengthening potential weaknesses of Named-Data Networking (NDN) in preventing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Such attacks disable their victims by overloading them with communications from “zombies” or “bots” — that is, computers that have already been compromised by hackers for malicious purposes.


NDN aims to replace the current Internet Protocol (IP). Rather than the IP method of assigning names to computers and addresses to their network interfaces, NDN names the content that travels through the network. To provide trust in communicated information, each piece of named content must be signed by its producer.


The current IP-based Internet allows anyone to “talk” to any entity, such as a computer or a router. This opens the door for DoS and attack types. And attacks are not the only problem with today’s Internet. Tsudik says the Internet’s decades-old architecture “was not designed for the kind of communication that takes place over it today: web traffic and rich multimedia communication. It was primarily designed for email and remote terminal access.”


In other words, the Internet is not just threatened by hackers and other miscreants; it is also a victim of its own popularity. Billions of people use it intensively, and cracks are starting to show.


Tsudik is one of a number of experts from dozens of institutions who answered the call from the National Science Foundation to construct a more resilient future Internet architecture. To make that next incarnation safer from attacks (such as DoS), Tsudik and his group at UCI are collaborating with colleagues at the Palo Alto Research Center — where the security team is lead by Ersin Uzun, a former Ph.D. student of Tsudik’s — and UCLA. They are also jointly exploring privacy protection techniques for NDN.

 






Patterson receives AIJ Prominent Paper Award

 Donald  Patterson 


Informatics associate professor Donald Patterson, with co-authors Lin Liao, Dieter Fox and Henry Kautz, have been recognized with the inaugural AIJ Prominent Paper Award. Their paper, “Learning and inferring transportation routines,” was published in volume 171 (April 2007) of the Artificial Intelligence journal. It introduces a hierarchical Markov model that can learn and infer a user’s daily movements through an urban community, and applies it in an application that helps cognitively-impaired people use public transportation safely.


The recently instituted AIJ Prominent Paper Award recognizes outstanding papers published not more than five years ago in the AI Journal that are exceptional in their significance and impact. Factors considered for the award include: the paper’s influence on a new line of research, whether the paper has made any major theoretical advances, and whether the paper has influenced applications.


Patterson said he and his co-authors have decided to donate their 500 Euro prize — which Google will match 1:1 — to the Alzheimer’s Association, “which is in line with the ideas in the paper.” Patterson’s current research interests focus on context-aware computing and how to make a computer operate appropriately when it leaves the office and moves into the greater world. He is a faculty affiliate of LUCI (Laboratory for Ubiquitous Computing and Interaction).
