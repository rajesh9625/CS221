Franz amasses $3.9 million in research funding

 Michael  Franz 

This year alone, Computer Science Professor Michael Franz has accumulated over $3.9 million in research funding from prestigious organizations such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), Qualcomm, Oracle and Mozilla. This follows his trend of more than $1 million per year on average in research expenditures.
Franz currently runs two projects funded by DARPA’s Cyber Fault-Tolerant Attack Recovery (CFAR) Program, for which he received nearly $2 million and roughly $700,000 in May, respectively. The CFAR Program aims to “produce revolutionary breakthroughs in defensive cyber techniques that can be deployed to protect existing and planned software systems in both military and civilian contexts without requiring changes to the concept of operations of these systems,” according to a statement by program manager John Everett.
Franz also runs a project funded by DARPA’s Vetting Commodity IT Software and Firmware Program (VET), which addresses “the threat of hidden malicious functionality in COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) IT devices ... including mobile phones, printers, computer workstations and many other everyday items,” according to a statement by program manager Timothy Fraser. He received nearly $65,000 for this project.
Finally, in July, Franz received nearly $620,000 from the NSF for a collaborative project titled “ENCORE—ENhanced program protection through COmpiler-REwriter cooperation.” According to the abstract, the project will produce “a prototype implementation consisting of a producer-side metadata derivation engine, and a consumer-side binary rewriting engine using this metadata to safely perform binary code manipulation.” In the past year, Franz has also received unrestricted gifts from Qualcomm, Oracle and Mozilla totaling $263,000.
 
    

    
Jones receives ACM SIGSOFT Impact Paper Award

Lopes’ Book Acknowledged as Best Programming Book of the Decade

 CristaLopes 

Informatics Professor Crista Lopes’ book, Exercises in Programming Style, has been named best programming book of the decade in a Software Development (SD) Times review. A compilation of 33 different styles for writing programs and designing systems, the book, released last summer, can be used in conjunction with a GitHub-hosted repository of code. In the review, SD Times columnist Larry O’Brien calls the book “the best programming book to come along in many years.”
As previously reported by the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, Lopes wrote her book as a response to a recurring programming student problem. While students could write code that worked, they often had no idea how to structure it, leaving their work difficult to decipher and vulnerable to bugs. Lopes' book resolves this issue through a series of constraints: It takes a simple computational task and demonstrates 33 different ways to possibly structure it. “Every programmer will find some styles that trigger a happy recognition and others that cause an intriguing confusion. Every chapter is a delight,” O’Brien writes.
“I made an effort to write a book that is both informative and fun,” Lopes says in response to the review. “It's very rewarding to see that people are getting my message!”
At the review’s end, O’Brien commends the book further: “I honestly cannot think of a more enlightening and more valuable text that’s been published since the turn of the century,” he wrote. “The hardest part about reviewing it is coming up with a way to say ‘Every developer should read this book’ in a way that doesn’t come across as clichéd and rote. Seriously. Every developer should read this book.”
 
    

    
Informatics Ph.D. student speaks about consumer privacy at TEDxUCIrvine

 Bart  Knijnenburg 

Former informatics Ph.D. student Bart Knijnenburg, who is joining the Human-Centered Computing division at Clemson University as an assistant professor in the fall, was a featured speaker at this year’s TEDxUCIrvine. Pulling from his expertise in privacy decision-making and user-centric evaluation of adaptive systems, Knijnenburg delivered a talk titled “How Come They Know So Much About Me?” According to Knijnenburg, “Addressing the privacy decision problem is crucial because an increasingly important part of our social and financial lives happens online, and if we constantly feel that we’re being monitored, and hacked and tracked, then how can we freely express ourselves.” Watch Knijnenburg’s full TEDxUCIrvine talk here.
 
    

    
Kobsa-edited UMUAI journal celebrates silver anniversary

 Alfred  Kobsa 

User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction: The Journal of Personalization Research (UMUAI), an interdisciplinary journal edited by Informatics Professor Alfred Kobsa, celebrates its 25th anniversary with the August 2015 volume. The annual journal has long been a forum for research into the adaptability and personalization of interactive computer systems.
According to Kobsa, the journal has come a long way since its launch in 1991. “When the journal was launched 25 years ago the idea that computers should adapt to each individual user was virtually unheard of,” he says. “Today, however, personalization can be found everywhere on the Web.”
As an interdisciplinary forum, the journal serves audiences in several fields, including human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, the instructional sciences, information systems, linguistics, and the information sciences. It publishes papers on applications in office machines and consumer electronics, applications in ubiquitous and mobile computing, privacy and security of information for personalization, and cultural adaptation, among many other topics.
UMUAI consistently ranks high in field-specific metrics. According to 2014 Source-Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP) statistics, the journal is ranked:
No. 5 among 84 journals in human-computer interactionNo. 4 among 918 journals in educationNo. 5 among 507 journals in computer science applicationsNo. 12 among more than 1,000 journals in computer scienceNo. 5 among Microsoft Academic Search’s 26 human-computer interaction journals.
Since 2002, the journal has also been known for awarding the James Chen Annual Award for Best UMUAI Article, a $1,000 cash prize commemorating James R. Chen, a creative researcher in the area of user modeling and information retrieval, and twice a UMUAI author. Members of the editorial board form an award committee each year to evaluate the nominees
 
    

    
UCI ranked one of the top universities to land a job in Silicon Valley

In a July 2015 article from Business Insider, UC Irvine is ranked one of the top 20 universities in the nation most likely to land students jobs in Silicon Valley. The data came from recruiting platform Jobvite after it analyzed 7 million job applications and 40,000 hires to determine which universities had the most number of students hired by the best companies in and around Silicon Valley, which has become home to several of the world’s largest high-tech corporations and a hotbed for tech startup companies. With Silicon Valley being a prime job market for ICS graduates, this is great news because, as the article states, “If your degree comes from one of these schools, you’re in demand.” Read the full story online here.
 
    

    
NSF Awards $240,000 grant to UCI trio for researching distraction in security

 Alfred  Kobsa 


 Gene  Tsudik 

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded a $240,000 Early-Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) to three UCI professors who are researching distraction in security. The co-principal investigators for the project include Informatics Professor Alfred Kobsa, Chancellor’s Professor of Computer Science Gene Tsudik, and Associate Professor of Cognitive Science Bruce Berg.
Today’s technology allows, and sometimes requires, people to engage in security-critical tasks in often distracting public spaces. For example, a user may need to enter a PIN, enter a password, or solve a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) on his smartphone in distracting settings. According to the group’s proposal summary, “User errors or delays while performing security-critical tasks can lead to undesirable or even disastrous consequences.” The impact of such errors or delays has yet to be investigated. However, using a fully automated experimental setup, this project will study whether and how sensory stimuli influence users’ behavior and trigger mistakes.
The project is in its preliminary stages, but, according to the professors, it entails two potentially transformational research ideas: “If sensory stimuli have a negative effect on users performing security-relevant tasks, its better understanding can lead to awareness and eventual countermeasures,” they say. “If, however, certain auditory stimuli actually improve user performance, new opportunities would arise for applying audio stimuli as a means of aiding users.” The work also “further explores the feasibility of conducting security-related user studies in a fully automated manner, which makes large-scale studies feasible and also avoids any potential experimenter bias.”
According to the NSF website, funding from the NSF EAGER program “may be used to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches.” NSF EAGER-funded projects often entail radically different and experimental approaches to scientific research.

Grad students participate in global UCSB iCTF hacking competition; place third among U.S. teams

Graduate students from the SPROUT (Security & Privacy Research OUTfit) and SSLLAB (Secure Systems & Software Laboratory) research groups at UCI collaborated as a team, called KHCZUU Labs, to participate in this year’s UC Santa Barbara International Capture The Flag (iCTF) competition. The iCTF contest is an annual competition where academic teams pit their skills at cyber attacks and defenses against each other. In security capture-the-flag events, the teams compete to try to find vulnerabilities in programs provided by the organizers and hack other teams to steal “flags,” while defending their own flags. CTF events provide a realistic but safe environment to learn and practice how real-world computer security works.
Even though most of the UCI team members were new to the competition, KHCZUU still managed to place third out of the U.S. teams and 31st overall, out of nearly 100 participating teams. "The whole team is looking forward to next year’s competition and plans to practice the necessary computer security skills in the meantime," says UCI Ph.D. candidate Stephen Crane. “For most on the team, this was their first experience with capture-the-flag-style competitions, and the competition was an amazing learning experience for everyone who participated.”
Congratulations to everyone who competed on this year's KHCZUU team: Brian Belleville, Stephen Crane, Sky Faber, Cesar Ghali, Julian Lettner, Ekin Oguz, Mohaned Qunaibit, Marc Schlosberg, and Stijn Volckaert (visiting scholar from Ghent University).

Report shows ICS grad degrees lead to high-paying, low-stress jobs

Those graduating this spring with advanced degrees in statistics, informatics, computer science and other information sciences can rest easy, according to a graduate degree and job prospect report released by Fortune magazine. Time Inc.’s business magazine—best known for its business revenue ranking list the “Fortune 500”—commissioned career website PayScale to identify the top 15 graduate degrees that lead to lucrative careers, and those that lead to high stress and low pay. The top four graduate degrees included doctorates in statistics and computer science, and master’s degrees in biostatistics and human-computer interaction. Several information science-related degrees rounded out the top 15, including master’s degrees in statistics, computer science, software engineering, and information science.
The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) offers graduate degrees in nearly all of these fields, with master’s and doctoral degrees offered in statistics, computer science, software engineering, and an innovative approach to human-computer-interaction with the informatics program. ICS was ranked 23rd worldwide among computer science graduate programs by U.S. News and World Report in 2014.
PayScale evaluated graduate degrees based on long-term outlook for job growth, mid-career median salaries, job satisfaction scores and work stress levels. Specific breakdowns of these figures can be found in Fortune’s complete report.
 
    

    
UCI ranked top school for game design and development, according to College Magazine and ACR

College Magazine ranked UC Irvine first in its list “10 Best Schools for Gamers,” while the university placed in the top 20% nationally on the Animation Career Review’s (ACR) 2015 Game Design and Development School Rankings, both rankings came out in May 2015. ACR ranked UC Irvine’s game development cachet 25th nationally, eighth among public institutions and the sixth best on the West Coast. Among the reasons for the No. 1 ranking, College Magazine commended UCI’s consistently strong showing at the annual IvyLoL National Championship, a collegiate League of Legends tournament, observing: “With a gaming community half a thousand students strong, UC Irvine proves that games are only fun if you have people to share them with.”
Both lists recognize UCI’s computer game science major, offered by ICS, which combines a solid foundation in computer science with a focus on designing, building, and understanding computer games and other forms of interactive media. The fundamentals of information and computer science — along with coursework in mathematics, statistics, physics, and film and media studies — provide students with the concepts and tools to study a wide scope of computer game technologies.
"I'm excited to see that UC Irvine's computer game science major is moving up in the rankings,” says Informatics Lecturer Dan Frost. “The world is discovering what our students already know — that we provide a top-notch education, an enthusiastic student body and faculty, and an excellent track record of placing students in game-industry jobs."

Stats professor receives $160,000 NSF grant for neuroscience-focused research

 Hernando  Ombao 

Statistics professor Hernando Ombao has received a $160,000 grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for his collaborative research project, “Bayesian State-Space Models for Behavioral Time Series Data.” With a focus on neuroscience and its analysis and integration of behavioral and neural-derived data, the project will develop novel statistical models and inferential methods for the analysis of multi-domain behavioral data and time series with complex temporal and dependence structures.
“This NSF proposal will be useful as we build our group of students at UCI who are working on statistical methods that will push forward boundaries of neuroscience research,” Ombao says.
Such research has broad-reaching impact, with the potential to advance knowledge on the neural underpinnings of human and animal behavior; integrate data from different domains to be used by behavioral scientists to test directly for associations between decision making and brain response; and advance knowledge in other fields that collect temporal data with complex structure, such as sociology (network modeling), environmental sciences, linguistics and signal processing.
The grant comes from the NSF’s Division of Social and Economic Sciences (SES). According to the SES website, the division “seeks to enhance our understanding of human, social and organizational behavior by building social science infrastructure, [and] by developing social disciplinary and interdisciplinary research projects that advance knowledge in the social and economic sciences.”

Ito presents on 'connected learning' at SXSWedu Conference

 Mimi  Ito 

South by Southwest’s education conference (SXSWedu) held in Austin, Texas, invited research scientist Mimi Ito to present at its newly formed closing program in March. Ito discussed “connected learning,” the concept of harnessing information and social connectivity for education. She presented alongside GRAMMY Museum Executive Director Bob Santelli, actress and founder of Hawn Foundation Goldie Hawn, and Khan Academy founder and Executive Director Sal Khan.
The single-stage closing program highlighted unique educational convergences by exploring education through the lens of music, film and interactive technologies. “The closing session is a new format, and intended to bridge the education and interactive programs,” Ito says. “I think it is an important signal that we need to find ways to unite the social agenda of educational reform to innovative technology approaches.”
Ito’s discussion of connected learning advocated for using today's tools to advance the longstanding goals of progressive education. “Too often, new educational technologies are used to reinforce traditional forms of education which we know are not effective or empowering to the learner. We have the opportunity to change that,” she says.

Informatics professor Bill Tomlinson was appointed to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Board of Scientific Counselors (BOSC) Sustainable and Healthy Communities Subcommittee earlier this year. The EPA BOSC provides counsel and information to the Office of Research and Development (ORD), the scientific research arm of the EPA. Per the BOSC mission statement, BOSC members evaluate and advise research programs and practices at the EPA, evaluate the use of and provide peer-review at ORD, review ORD’s program development progress, and advise human resources planning, such as scientist career development and rotational assignment programs.
As a member of the Sustainable and Healthy Communities Subcommittee, Tomlinson is involved with the subcommittee’s research program. This program works to provide the knowledge and tools to answer the question: “How do we meet today’s needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs in ways that are economically viable, beneficial to human health and well-being, and socially just?”
According to the EPA, “Members of the BOSC subcommittees constitute a distinguished body of scientists and engineers who are recognized experts in their respective fields.” BOSC subcommittee members report to the executive committee. All BOSC members are drawn from academia, industry, governments, non-governmental and environmental organization, as well as research laboratories, among other relevant entities.
The subcommittee aligns with Tomlinson’s research interests, which involve the social impacts of information technologies, environmental issues and interactive education systems.

NSA, DHS again dub UCI a National Center of Academic Excellence in cybersecurity research

 Gene  Tsudik 

UC Irvine has been redesignated a National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Research for academic years 2015-2019 by the National Security Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. “This acknowledges UCI’s prominence and growing impact, as well as expertise, in information assurance,” said Chancellor’s Professor of computer science Gene Tsudik, who heads the Secure Computing & Networking Center at the Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences. “It also highlights UCI’s ability to help the nation in educating and training IA specialists.” The program is intended to reduce vulnerabilities in — and threats to — the national information infrastructure by facilitating graduate education and research and training both researchers and practitioners. In addition, the redesignation allows UCI to compete for targeted grants from the National Science Foundation, the DHS and the NSA. For more information, visit the NSA National Centers of Academic Excellence website.

Informatics graduate student awarded Global Food Initiative fellowship

 Ankita  Raturi 

Ankita Raturi, a graduate student in informatics, is one of five UC Irvine students who have been awarded $2,500 fellowships to fund projects that focus on food issues. They’re among 54 University of California students receiving support from UC President Janet Napolitano’s Global Food Initiative Student Fellowship Program for efforts addressing such subjects as community gardens, food pantries, urban agriculture and food waste.
Raturi will work to develop a software program that models the environmental impact of agricultural systems. Called the Open Resource Tracker, the program will be designed to help understand how resources flow both within and between food systems. The software could theoretically be used with any resource-consuming system (e.g., farms, restaurants, factories). While the primary audience for this tool will be those directly involved in the environmental assessment of food systems —farmers, analysts and government workers — it will also have a consumer-facing interface.
The Global Food Initiative was launched in July to align the UC’s research, outreach and operations in a sustained effort to develop, demonstrate and export solutions — throughout California, the United States and the world — for food security, health and sustainability.
 
    

    
UCI ranks in top 20 nationally for theoretical computer science

 Michael  Goodrich 


 David  Eppstein 


 Sandy  Irani 

Theoretical computer science at ICS scores in the top 20 computer science departments nationally, according to a ranking list developed collaboratively by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the University of Maryland.
The list, titled “Ranking of CS Departments based on the Number of Papers in Theoretical Computer Science,” was developed in response to a perceived lack of transparency in the criteria for U.S. News and World Report’s Best Graduate Schools for theoretical computer science list. Theoretical computer science includes a focus on logic and mathematics. The list considers the quality of computer science department faculty at respective schools and publication rates in major computer science conferences as key ranking measures. It is a part of a larger MIT and University of Maryland collaborative project, titled “BigDND: Big Dynamic Network Data.”
There are two ranking lists, each developed with the same dataset but using a different equation to organize the data. Depending on the list, computer science at UC Irvine comes in at 18th or 19th place, beating out Ivy League schools like Harvard and Yale.
Chancellor's Professor Michael Goodrich attributes UC Irvine’s placement on the list to the work coming out of the Center for Algorithms and Theory of Computation, of which he is technical director and Chancellor’s Professor David Eppstein is director. The center’s research seeks to produce rigorously tested results about problems dealing with computers and their applications. In a recent example, professor Sandy Irani, in collaboration with professor Shahram Ghandeharizadeh at USC, has developed several novel algorithms for managing key-value caches for database management systems that greatly reduce processing overhead and enhance system throughput.
“I think this ranking data is an excellent recognition of impact the faculty in the center are having on the area,” Goodrich says.
The list is currently a Beta version; the developers welcome feedback at csdepartmentranking@gmail.com.
 
    

    
Kobsa receives $666,000 from NSF to research user privacy decision support

 Alfred  Kobsa 

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded informatics and computer science professor Alfred Kobsa $666,000 to research user privacy decision support.
Even though consumers want to be in charge of their privacy and current privacy norms and research recommend transparency and user control, expecting all users to make all privacy decisions themselves turns out to be unrealistic. Kobsa’s proposal, “A User-Tailored Approach to Privacy Decision Support,” seeks to realistically empower users for privacy choices, through personalized default settings and through rationales for disclosure that best suit users’ predicted decision-making. Throughout his research, he will work with industry to deploy solutions for privacy decision support.
The research is funded by the NSF Social & Economic Sciences (SES) division, which “seeks to enhance our understanding of human, social and organizational behavior by building social science infrastructure, by developing social disciplinary and interdisciplinary research projects that advance knowledge in the social and economic sciences,” according to the website.

 Bill  Tomlinson 


 Don  Patterson 

The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded informatics professor Bill Tomlinson $400,000 for his project “Fostering Non-Expert Creation of Sustainable Polycultures through Crowdsourced Data Synthesis.” Associate professor Donald Patterson and Assistant Professor of Crop Sciences at the University of Illinois Sarah Taylor Lovell serve as co-principal investigators.
The project integrates research in computing and sustainability science with the goal of enabling a new approach to sustainable food security. By combining cyber-human systems and crowdsourcing research with the science of agroecology, the project seeks to develop an understanding of how online design tools may contribute to sustainability through enhanced local food production; to use the process of populating a plant species database as an instance of a class of problems amenable to intelligent crowdsourcing; and to pioneer new knowledge in crowdsourcing optimization.
According to the project abstract, “The work will contribute to long-term food security and offer lessons, concepts, methods, and software tools that may be transferable to other sustainability challenges.”
The award is part of the Cyber-Innovation for Sustainability Science and Engineering (CyberSEES) program at NSF, and is funded through the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations (CCF), which supports research and education projects that explore the foundations of computing and communication devices and their usage. According to the CCF website, “CCF-supported projects also investigate revolutionary computing models and technologies based on emerging scientific ideas and integrate research and education activities to prepare future generations of computer science and engineering workers.”
