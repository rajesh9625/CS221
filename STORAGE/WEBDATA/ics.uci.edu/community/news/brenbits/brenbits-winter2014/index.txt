                                    VIDEO: ICS student named Homecoming King
                                

 

	David Conley (right), a senior in the computer game science program, earned his homecoming crown by besting eight other students in contests of talent, improvisational skills, campus knowledge and physical feats throughout the week leading up to the Homecoming men's basketball game in January. He also created a YouTube campaign video that featured a parody of the tune "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" from 
The Lion King. In this video profile, Conley talks about how he can't imagine having gone anywhere else but UCI. Watch the Video
