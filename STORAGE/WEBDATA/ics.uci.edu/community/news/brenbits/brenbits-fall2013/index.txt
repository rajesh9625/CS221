	DEAN'S MESSAGE
	
	What a year! This fall, the Bren School of ICS welcomed a freshman class that comprises nearly 470 students — a 50-percent-plus increase from 2012 and more than triple the number that enrolled just five years ago. Indeed, 2013 has given us many reasons to celebrate: student and alumni accomplishments, faculty accolades, exciting new programs, and support from friends who generously give their time and resources. Thank you for your part in making the Bren School an exceptional community. I wish you a wonderful holiday season and a joyous 2014.

	— Hal Stern
	Ted and Janice Smith Family Foundation Dean
