Giving

Informatics Ph.D. candidate Maryam Khademi (above right) is the first recipient of the new Fred M. Tonge Endowed Graduate Award, which was established during UCI’s 50th Anniversary Celebration in October 2015. The award, named in honor of founding ICS and UCI faculty member Fred M. Tonge, gives recipients $1,000 toward their education. The award fund was made possible with a generous donation from ICS alumna Marsha Drapkin Hopwood, Ph.D. 1974. "The ICS experience opened a world of opportunity for me," says Hopwood. "I believe it is important to contribute to providing similar opportunities for current and future students."
