  Friends of the Donald Bren School





As public funding for our state's universities declines and the
                costs and risks of corporate R&D escalate, there is increasing
                motivation for forging bonds between academia and industry.
The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences is research oriented -- even at the undergraduate level -- with
                formal projects addressing hardware, software, algorithm design,
                artificial intelligence and the societal impacts of computing. 
Research-orientated education means ICS students arrive at 
                companies already comfortable on the leading edge and poised to make
                an immediate
                impact.
In addition to students, our world-renowed faculty work with outside
            companies and frequently collaborate with professionals in
            other academic
            areas
            to create
            even greater synergy. 
This results in a combination of corporate
            insight, faculty guidance and student energy that has proven time
            and again to be the spark that ignites tomorrow’s products
          and services.
The ICS programs listed below offer you an opportunity to interface with our students and faculty.

Butterworth Product Development CompetitionThis competition offers an opportunity for students to develop their business skills and earn cash prizes. Learn more »
Tech JobsWhether you are looking for computer science interns, part-time or full-time employees, Tech Jobs is the place for you. Post your job opening and know that you are reaching ICS students and alumni each and every time! Learn more » 
Scholarships & FellowshipsSupport a student by sponsoring a scholarship or fellowship. In forging relationships with the students they support, current donors have discovered that ICS students are more than scholars, they also are community volunteers, dedicated youth leaders, responsible young adults and promising future professionals. Learn more »
