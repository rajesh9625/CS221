	 I am a data scientist at Dato, Inc. I obtained a Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at University of California, Irvine, working with Padhraic Smyth and the DataLab.
	  

	  My research focuses on probabilistic models for relational events, e.g. communication or interaction within a social network.
	  
	  
	  In 2012 I co-organized a workshop on algorithmic and statistical approaches for  large social networks at NIPS 2012.
	  

	  In 2012 I was an intern at Microsoft Research in the Machine Learning group working under Chris Meek.
Much of my research throughout grad school has been supported by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship.
