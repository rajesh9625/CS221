  David Redmiles is a Professor in the Department of Informatics
  at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). He is the author of over 100 research
  publications integrating the areas of software engineering, human-computer
  interaction, and computer-supported cooperative work. He has graduated 8 PhD
  students and served on the dissertation committees of over 30 other PhD
  students. For many years, he has been involved in the IEEE/ACM Conference on
  Automated Software Engineering, serving on the steering committee and
  organizing the 2005 conference as General Chair. That research community
  designated him Fellow of Automated Software Engineering in 2009 and in 2010
  awarded him and his co-authors the first Most Influential Paper Award for
  their 1996 paper on software design environments. The Argo/UML system
  described in that paper continues to evolve as a widely adopted design tool
  supported by a lively open-source community. His current research focuses 
on distributed and collaborative software engineering, especially the 
aspects of awareness and trust among collaborators. From 2004 to 2011, he chaired
  the Department of Informatics at UCI. During this period there was a great
  expansion of the faculty, facilities, and degree programs.
