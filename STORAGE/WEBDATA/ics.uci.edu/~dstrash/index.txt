										About Me
									
                                    I am a hard-working technophile who is committed to open science and equality in education. My goal is to produce innovative high-quality research, and use my extensive research and practical experience to effectively teach and mentor the next generation of computer scientists. 
									In 2011, I received a PhD in Computer Science from University of California, Irvine under the advisement of David Eppstein and Mike Goodrich. From there, I worked in research and development in Intel's Computational Lithography Group until 2014. Now, I am a postdoctoral researcher with Peter Sanders at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
                                    If you are looking for more information, here is my CV, my research statement, and my teaching statement.

									My passion is to reveal and resolve the mismatch between the theory and practice of algorithms, with applications in large scale network analysis and computational geometry. My work often involves first understanding real-world properties of data sets, then designing algorithms that exploit these properties to gain efficiency that is not possible otherwise. This includes both theoretical efficiency and efficiency of algorithms in practice (algorithm engineering). Some specific areas that interest me are combinatorial optimization, subgraph counting/listing, network visualization, shortest paths, range searching, and dynamic data structures.
