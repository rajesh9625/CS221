      Inter-machine communications have always been kept away
from our own communication channel, audible sound in air. There are
good reasons for this: the data rates are relatively low when compared
to other media (e.g. electric wires, radio) and the sounds tend to be
annoying. But as more and more devices support an audio channel for
voice or music, that channel becomes a cheap option for transferring
arbitrary information among devices that happen to be near each other.
Sound is attractive for applications that do not require high bit rates
and for which it is expensive to extend the hardware infrastructure
with radio or infrared transmitters. Some examples of those
applications are: toys; broadcasting information through the sound of
TV and radio that can be picked up by devices at home or in the car;
transferring names and phone numbers between cell phones; transferring
business cards between PDAs; and broadcasting location-dependent
information from rooms into PDAs and laptops. Sound also has some
natural advantages over other media when security is at stake.

      Motivated by the specific characteristics of the aerial
acoustic communication paradigm used by humans and other animals, the
Digital Voices project explores the use of sound as a communication
medium in ubiquitous computing environments. The inter-machine aerial
acoustic communications are designed along the following criteria: 

       The messages of these communication systems are
pleasant to humans. They are either imperceptible or, if perceivable,
they sound like music or familiar environment sounds such as birds,
wind or water drops.  The systems are to be deployed in ordinary hardware.
We utilize the existing infrastructure for voice, avoiding extra costs.
         The systems are used in ordinary environments. This
means that the communication has to be reasonably robust in the
presence of noise such as people talking. 

      Listen to the sound samples on the left. For those of you who like challenges, try to
decode the whole of the messages in the "Listen" list on the left. If
you can do it, I would like to hear from you! For checking
your result and for general information, please contact Prof. Crista Lopes.
