      I joined ICS in
the Fall of 2002. Prior to being in ICS, I was a Research Scientist at
the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.
While at PARC, I am most known as a founder of the group that
developed Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and started
aspectj.org. My interests have expanded considerably since then. To
find out about my current projects and students, follow the links on
the left or visit the mondego
pages.
      
      I have B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical and
Computer Engineering from 
Instituto Superior Técnico, in Lisbon, and a Ph.D.
in Computer Science from Northeastern
University, in Boston. I also studied piano and voice, and
have sung in choirs such as the San
Francisco Symphony Chorus (1999-2002) and the Gulbenkian
Choir (1989-1992).   I received a National Science
Foundation's CAREER Award, 2004-2009.  I'm 
Erdos number 3 (Erdos -> Specker -> Lieberherr
-> me).
