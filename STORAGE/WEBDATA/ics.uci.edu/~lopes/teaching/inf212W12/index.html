INF 212 - Analysis of Programming LanguagesINF 212
Analysis of Programming Languages

Synopsis 

        Purpose.
	    The study of programming languages and their use in software
            systems engineering -- partly theoretical, partly empircal. 
	    Includes an introduction to the formal aspects 
	    of programming languages, program analysis techniques and
            large-scale analysis of software projects.

       Evaluation.
        Projects (90%) + Class participation (10%)

	Pedagogy:
	  The course's 20 or so lecture slots will be half formal lectures
	  and half discussion sessions.
        - Lectures give overview of the material 
        - Projects are hands-on vehicles for learning the material.

Academic Honesty

I trust all students are honest and do not cheat. Those who break my trust
at any point will get an F in the course - no excuses or apologies will be
accepted.Additional penalties may also be imposed by the
department and the university. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can
result in suspension or expulsion from the university. 



Students with Disability

Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the
impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her
specific needs. Also contact the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494
as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented
in a timely fashion.
