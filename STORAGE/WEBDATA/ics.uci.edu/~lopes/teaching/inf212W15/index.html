Academic Honesty

I trust all students are honest and do not cheat. Those who break my trust
at any point will get an F in the course - no excuses or apologies will be
accepted.Additional penalties may also be imposed by the
department and the university. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can
result in suspension or expulsion from the university. 



Students with Disability

Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on the
impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss his or her
specific needs. Also contact the Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494
as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented
in a timely fashion.
