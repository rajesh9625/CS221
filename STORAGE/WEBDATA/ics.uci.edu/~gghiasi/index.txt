        		I am a Computer Science PhD student at the University of California Irvine and a member   
                of Computational Vision Group where I am advised by Prof. Charless Fowlkes.
				
		 		My research interest is Computer Vision and Machine Learning. My current research is focused on Pose Estimation in the Presence of Occlusion.
