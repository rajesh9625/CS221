				About Me
			 
			
        		
        			I am a PhD student in Donald Bren Schoold of Information and Computer Science at University of California, Irvine. My advisor is Bren Professor 
					Ramesh Jain.
        			
        			My research focuses on building a context awareness system which analyzes contexts and then detects human�� high level daily activities called life events. It turns myriad data collected from mobile devices or wearable devices into chronological data stream and then builds a human event model on a real time basis. I am building a complete infrastructure for Objective Self and hope to demonstrate its applicability in a few application soon.
��        			
					My research interest is intelligent system, context-awareness, machine learning, data mining and information retrieval.
					I do not want to do just pure theoretical approaches, but applying my research into the real-world application. I am a mobile person, as well. I enjoy utilizing the mobile device in my research.
