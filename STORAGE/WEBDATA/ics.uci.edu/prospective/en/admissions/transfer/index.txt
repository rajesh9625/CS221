                The Bren School has articulation agreements with California community colleges that allow you to take courses that not only meet our admissions criteria, but can also be applied to our degree requirements.  If you have not done so already, check out www.assist.org for the latest articulation agreement specifically between your community college and UC Irvine.  If you plan it right, most of our majors support you in starting with your upper-division major requirements in your first quarter as a Bren School and UCI student.
                
                
                
                Some community colleges such as Orange Coast College, Long Beach City College, and Fullerton College, have a more direct and specialized articulation program called Smart-ICS.  For more information about this agreement, please visit the CS department at one of these community colleges.
                
                
                 
              The campus offers a wealth of information for prospective freshmen, as well as details on all aspects of the admissions process. We particularly encourage you to explore the following:
