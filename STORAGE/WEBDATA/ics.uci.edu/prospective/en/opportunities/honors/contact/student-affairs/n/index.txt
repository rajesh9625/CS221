               UCI offers a vibrant honors program (CHP, the Campuswide Honors Program), for which Bren School students are eligible. This program offers select events, peer mentorship, a campus “hang out” where you and your fellow honors students convene, work, and socialize, honors housing, and special research opportunities. The Bren School traditionally has a strong representation in the CHP program.
               
               
               
               The Bren School also offers its own research honor sequence. Juniors and seniors have the opportunity to learn about the research process and engage in advanced work with a faculty advisor. Students admitted to the program participate in an honors seminar, conduct independent research under the guidance of a faculty advisor (for a minimum of two quarters), and write a research paper for review by their faculty advisor and the Honors Program Faculty Director.
