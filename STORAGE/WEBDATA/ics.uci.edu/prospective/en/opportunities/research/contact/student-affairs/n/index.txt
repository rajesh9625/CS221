             Every quarter in the Bren School, scores of undergraduate students (including first- and second-year students) work on research projects with faculty. There is no prerequisite. If you and a professor agree to work together, you can, for as long as you want to.
             
             
             
             By working directly with professors, you not only get a taste of what cutting-edge research is like, you also get a preview of what graduate school might be like. Many undergraduates work not only with the faculty member, but also closely with the Ph.D. and M.S. students that the faculty member may employ.
             
             
             
             You become part of a team. As a result, it is not uncommon for undergraduate researchers to be co-authors on scientific publications. Some, indeed, have led these efforts and are first authors.
             
             
             
             As an undergraduate researcher, you will sharpen your skills on complex problems that are still in the process of being defined, and understand what contributes to a research project’s success. Participation in undergraduate research also positions you well to attend graduate or professional (MBA, Law, etc.) schools. Our alumni succeed at Stanford, UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia Tech, Columbia, Harvard, MIT, and others.
