	            Bren School students are not just students. They want to shape their careers and society. Their entrepreneurial spirit shows up in many ways. Every year students form teams to compete in hITEC, our product development competition that involves industrial mentors and over $9,000 in prizes. The past two years' winning product ideas have gone on to form actual startups:
	            
	            

	            Clarity Labs leverages TV audiences' consumer behavior through a tag placement application that allows viewers to click on their favorite products in any given TV show for convenient online shopping.Olepta revolutionizes relationship management for medical practitioners by modernizing the start-to-finish practice workflow. Its software opens new channels between the medical provider, the patient, insurance provider, family members, and all other parties involved in a patient's medical history.

	            
	            The top three product development teams in hITEC automatically qualify for The Paul Merage School of Business's annual Stradling Yocca Carlson & Rauth Business Plan Competition with cash awards totaling $30,000.
	            
    	        
    	        
    	        As exemplified by Clarity Labs and Olepta, every year some of 
    	        our of students launch new start-up companies to apply their 
    	        innovative spirit to networking, gaming, medical information 
    	        systems, internet technology, or some other area. A student who is 
    	        interested in participating in one of these product development 
    	        competitions may enroll in the Entrepreneurship course taught by Bren 
    	        Professor Ramesh Jain, who has founded three 
    	        highly successful companies himself.
