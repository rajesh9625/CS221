              UC Irvine’s student body is very diverse, and offers a wealth of opportunities to learn with and from students whose backgrounds and experiences support, complement, challenge, enrich, or expand your understanding of how to learn, live, and work in a multicultural society.   
              
              
              
              Even within the smaller Bren School student community, our students’ backgrounds and interests are richly diverse – as represented by their participation in extracurricular activities that include dance troupes, athletics, theater, community service, ROTC, greek-letter organizations, ethnic/cultural group affiliations, and leadership in student clubs and organizations.
