     Campus Involvement
                
                
                When you first visit the UCI campus, you will see that it is a pretty large place. Most students will tell you that a good way to get connected and make the campus feel smaller is to join a student club.  Spend a couple minutes searching the Dean of Student’s database of over 300 registered student organizations to get a sense of the kinds of involvements and activities that might be of interest to you while here at UCI: http://www.campusorgs.uci.edu/.
                
                
                
                Many opportunities exist for learning about and practicing your leadership skills, both in the UCI community (e.g., Student Government, Housing) and Bren School student-run organizations. 
                
                
                
                It will be up to you to decide what types of involvement, teamwork, and leadership experiences you want to acquire as you find your place in the UCI community.
