     Overview



                
                The field of computer science continues to rapidly change as new technical 
                possibilities and new application areas constantly arise. Your education must keep 
                pace and position you for an exciting and relevant career. A single degree program 
                can no longer do this in the face of how broad and all-encompassing the field has 
                become. The Bren School is known worldwide for its long history of innovative educational 
                programs, and continues this tradition today with six streamlined majors for you to 
                choose from.
                
                
                
                All majors share a strong foundation, each branching from there to provide you with a 
                tailored, modern curriculum that builds upon our ever-expanding portfolio of courses; 
                courses that we carefully and continuously update to stay current.
                

                
                
                Our counselors can assist you in choosing the right major. Because our majors share a 
                core philosophy, should your interests change after arrival you will be able to change 
                majors in your freshman or early in your sophomore year without having to take 
                additional coursework.
