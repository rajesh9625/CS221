                Bren School academic advisors assist all Bren School majors, from start to finish of their academic career.  School-based academic advising begins with summer orientation, during which counselors help new students map out their academic plan and guide them through on-line registration for fall quarter classes.  Through the remainder of a student’s career, Bren School advisors are available to help define and support academic and career goal-setting, identify the most efficient routes for meeting degree requirements, and check for timely progress toward graduation.  The counseling staff also sponsor workshops for Bren School students about such topics as career exploration, internships, finding a faculty mentor, and graduate school preparation.  The Bren School academic advising staff offers assistance via individual appointments, drop-in counseling, and email .
