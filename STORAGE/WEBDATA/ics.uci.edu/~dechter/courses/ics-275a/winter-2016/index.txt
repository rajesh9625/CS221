								Course Goals
							
							
								Constraint satisfaction is a simple but powerful tool. Constraints identify the impossible and reduce the realm of possibilities to effectively focus on the possible, allowing for a natural
								declarative formulation of what must be satisfied, without expressing how. The field of constraint reasoning has matured over the last three decades with contributions from a diverse
								community of researchers in artificial intelligence, databases and programming languages, operations research, management science, and applied mathematics.
								
									The purpose of this course is to familiarize students with the theory and techniques of constraint processing, using the constraint graphical model. This model offers a natural language for
									encoding world knowledge in areas such as scheduling, vision, diagnosis, prediction, design, hardware and software verification, and bio-informatics, and it facilitates many computational
									tasks relevant to these domains such as constraint satisfaction, constraint optimization, counting and sampling . The course will focus on techniques for constraint processing. It will cover
									search and inference algorithms, consistency algorithms and structure based techniques and will focus on properties that facilitate efficient solutions. Extensions to general graphical
									models such as probabilistic networks, cost networks, and influence diagrams will be discussed as well as example applications such as temporal reasoning, diagnosis, scheduling, and
									prediction.
