Short Biography


Prof. Goodrich received his B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science
from Calvin College in 1983 and his PhD in Computer Sciences 
from Purdue University in 1987. 

He is a 
Chancellor's 
Professor at the 
University of California, Irvine, 
where he has been a faculty member in the Department of
Computer Science since 2001.
In addition, he currently serves as
Technical Director for the ICS 
Center for Algorithms 
and Theory of Computation. 
He was a professor in the Department of
Computer Science at 
Johns Hopkins University from 1987-2001.

Dr. Goodrich's research is directed at the design of high
performance algorithms and data structures with applications
to information assurance and security, 
the Internet, 
machine learning,
and geometric computing.
He has pioneered and led research on efficient 
solutions to a number
of fundamental problems, including sorting, convex hull construction,
nearest-neighbor searching,
linear programming, privacy-preserving data access, network traceback,
and data authentication.


With over 300 publications, including several widely-adopted
books, 
his recent work includes contributions to efficient and secure 
distributed data structures, 
information privacy,
social networks, 
and cloud security.
He has served as a consultant to AT&T, 
Walt Disney Animation Studios, and
the National Science Foundation. He has
experience as an expert witness in patent litigation
involving algorithms, cryptography, 
machine learning, digital rights management (DRM), 
computer security, networking, and storage technologies.
He is an 
ACM 
Distinguished Scientist, 
a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS), a Fulbright Scholar, a Fellow of the IEEE,
and a 
Fellow 
of the ACM.
He is a recipient of the
IEEE 
Computer Society Technical Achievement Award,
the NSF Research Initiation Award, 
the DARPA Spirit of Technology Transfer Award, 
the Brown Univ. Award for Technological Innovation,
the ACM Recognition of Service Award, and the Pond
Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching.


His 
Erd≈ës number
is three (3), here's why.
