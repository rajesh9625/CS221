Michael T. Goodrich - Erdős NumberMichael Goodrich's Erdős Number.



A person's 
Erdős
number 
is the degrees of separation from that
person to the famous mathematician Paul Erdős 
through research publications. That is, the
distance, in number of collaborations, from that person to Erdős. 
In fact, we can define a 
collaboration graph, where we create a
vertex for each person and link two people with an edge if they have
collaborated on a published research paper. 


Michael Goodrich's Erdős number is 3, which is realized in the
following (disjoint) ways in the collaboration graph:
 Erdős->Avis->Snoeyink->Goodrich
 Erdős->Pach->Bronnimann->Goodrich
 Erdős->Pollack->Agarwal->Goodrich
 Erdős->Alon->Vishkin->Goodrich
 Erdős->Aronov->Kosaraju->Goodrich
 Erdős->Wagstaff->Atallah->Goodrich
 Erdős->Silverman->Mount->Goodrich
 Erdős->Fraenkel->Scheinerman->Goodrich
 Erdős->Odlyzko->Guibas->Goodrich
 Erdős->Yao->Eppstein->Goodrich
 Erdős->Fishburn->Tanenbaum->Goodrich

For example, Goodrich coauthored a paper with Jack Snoeyink, who
coauthored a paper with David Avis, who coauthored a paper with Paul
Erdős.
