I am a 3rd year PhD 
candidate in Computer Science at the 
University of California, Irvine, working 
with Professor Nikil Dutt in 
DRG Lab
on the
Variability Expedition. 
I received my B.Sc. (Hons) and M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from
School of Electrical and Computer 
Engineering at University of Tehran in 
2009 and 2012 respectively, where I worked with
Professor Zain Navabi in
CAD Research Group. My current 
research is in the area of "Embedded Systems" with a specific focus 
on "Dynamic Variability and Reliability Management". Over the last years, I 
have 
researched in the areas of "Power Management in VLSI System" and "Design for 
Testability". My CV can be found here.
