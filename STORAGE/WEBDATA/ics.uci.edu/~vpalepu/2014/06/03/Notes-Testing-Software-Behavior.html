Q. How do you test/verify behaviors?

think about or in terms of behaviors.actually verify behaviors.

Q. How do you think about behaviors?
(what do i mean by that?)

old school testing demo: https://bitbucket.org/vpalepu/191b

“Introducing BDD” by Dan North.
Test method names should be sentences
    An expressive test name is helpful when a test fails
  “Behaviour” is a more useful word than “test”
    Emphasize behavior over testingDetermine the next most important behaviorThink: “what should the system should do?”;Not: “is the system right?”
  It is all about templates
    A simple sentence template keeps test methods focused
        The class should do something
      
        Story/Behavior Templates:

        As a [X]
  I want [Y]
  so that [Z]

        Given [some initial context (the givens)],
  When [an event occurs],
  then [ensure some outcomes].
      
  

Q. So are we really verifying behaviors with BDD?
(what do i mean by that?)

State vs Interactions
Most testing that we do is state based or value based testing. The issue with state based testing is that sometimes you can arrive at the right state with the wrong steps or interactions.Process over ResultsThe basic idea behind BDD is to think in terms of behaviors; you still might be doing the same old state or value based testing.
    So, BDD does not force test to Behaviors in terms of the actual interactions.
  

Mocking - testing interactions.

Mocks enable us to test interactions.Mocks are not Stubs or Fakes or Dummies.

Martin Fowler - “Mocks Aren’t Stubs”
http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html

Dummy objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill parameter lists.Fake objects actually have working implementations, but usually take some shortcut which makes them not suitable for production (an in memory database is a good example).Stubs provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what’s programmed in for the test. Stubs may also record information about calls, such as an email gateway stub that remembers the messages it ‘sent’, or maybe only how many messages it ‘sent’.
    Mocks are what we are talking about here: objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.
  “the calls they are expected to receive.”. Here calls refers to method calls.In the context of interactive applications like GUIs or Games, these method calls often represent interactions.Mocks keep track of all the method calls that are made/being made; check them against a specification, and flag errors if the specifications and reality do not match up.

Other Notes:

Mockito cannot mock final classes … String, Integer, ScannerLast stub always winsMockito uses a “verify what you want” philosophy for mocking, unlike most other mocking frameworks that use the “expect-run-verify” philosophy for mocking. more: “expect-run-verify… Goodbye!”, http://monkeyisland.pl/2008/02/01/deathwish/.
