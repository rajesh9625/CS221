  I spent a set of 12 amazing weeks this summer at Redmond, Washington, where I worked as an engineering intern with the Word engineering team at Microsoft.



Aside from the challenging work, it was nice to work and have fun with a great set of people! And it was not just work, but I also had a time of my life while enjoying great Washington weather, a Marron 5 rock concert, a hike upto 6,800 ft. along the slope of Mount Rainier, a visit to the original Starbucks store and numerous walks through the lovely streets of Seattle! It has been a time to remember.
