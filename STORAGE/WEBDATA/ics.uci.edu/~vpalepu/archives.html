              VISSFOT 2015 was held in Bremen, Germany this year and it turned out to be an interesting time there for me! I presented two works around novel visualizations and software research, and got some great appreciation and feedback for it! Despite being a young community, I found the conference engaging and I am evermore enthusiastic about the role of visualizations in the area of software engineeri...

              I spent a set of 12 amazing weeks this summer at Redmond, Washington, where I worked as an engineering intern with the Word engineering team at Microsoft.



Aside from the challenging work, it was nice to work and have fun with a great set of people! And it was not just work, but I also had a time of my life while enjoying great Washington weather, a Marron 5 rock concert, a hike upto 6,800 ft...

              The PL241-Compiler is an SSA-based optimizing compiler that supports copy propagation, common subexpression elimination, constant folding, register allocation and code generation for the DLX (pronounced ‘Deluxe’) RISC processor architecture.

I wrote the compiler as a part of a graduate course at UC Irvine. It was both a challenging and extremely useful course and compiler to work on. In fact, ...

questions that i am trying to answer:
- Who speaks the most? 
- Summaries of individual episodes? 
- Summaries of what each F.R.I.E.N.D.S. said?

So this was a cool class project that I worked on where we were to implement a lambda calculus interpreter in any language of our choice. It just seemed too natural to do this in Scheme. :)

It attempts to implement both alpha and beta reductions.

The following code for the interpreter is also available as a gist, with test cases: https://gist.github.com/VijayKrishna/5180292.js

The fact that there exists a common feature set across all games that are or may exist, is leveraged ...
