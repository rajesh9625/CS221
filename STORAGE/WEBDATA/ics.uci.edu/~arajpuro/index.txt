                                        My research and development efforts are primarily inspired towards developing the next-generation of internet and internet based applications. Within that universe, my focus is particularly on three aspects of future internet – Data Science (understanding the information flow over internet), Network Architecture (designing protocols for future internet), and Video Coding (improving the performance of the most popular data type used over internet). 
                                        
Data Science My work on Big Data for Business Managers was published in IEEE BigData 2013. Besides research work, I blog on Big Data trends at KDnuggets.com.

Network Architecture  Developed modules to facilitate the use and assessment of NDN (Named Data Networking) framework for real-life innovative applications such as server-less multi-user chat and environmental sensing. Technical Report (which I contributed to): http://named-data.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CCLTechReport.pdf

										Video Coding My research on video coding is currently on hold due to other time commitments. I am working on high performance low complexity alternatives to H.264/AVC, which would enable transmission of higher resolution videos to mobile devices(having low computational power) while also creating opportunities to boost security and protect IP rights.

                                                     The realtion manager administers the database tables. It handles the creation/deletion of tables and other basic operations performed on top of a table. Relation manager (RM) also creates and initializes catalog to store all information about database.

                                            I investigated why Big Data Return over Investment (ROI) lagged far behind its potential despite using the best technology and the best people. I did an extensive analysis of Big Data processes across industries from business as well as technology perspective.  To bridge the gaps in my analysis, I interviewed a few business managers and academic researchers. It was amazing to observe how dismal ROI results are linked to very basic set of common errors prevalent across the various steps of data mining. Based on this research I developed a generic ROI focused framework for leveraging Big Data, which could be easily customized to particular industry needs. My research work was selected for IEEE Big Data 2013. Based on the industry response at the conference, I am now working on developing a toolkit comprising of templates, checklists and industry benchmarks that can be conveniently used by Big Data business leaders with little background in technology.

                                                        Given the surge of interest in research, publication and application on Big Data over the last few years, the potential of Big Data seems to be well-established now across businesses. However, in most of the business implementations Big Data still seem to be struggling to deliver the promised value (ROI). Such results despite using the market leading Big Data solutions and talented deployment team are forcing the business managers to think what needs to be done differently. This paper lays down the framework for business managers to understand Big Data processes. Besides providing a business overview of Big Data core components, the paper presents several questions that the managers must ask to assess the effectiveness of their Big Data processes. This paper is based on the analysis of several Big Data projects that never delivered and comparison against successful ones. The hypothesis is developed based on public information and is proposed as the first step for business managers keen on effectively leveraging Big Data.

                                                In collaboration with Dr. Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro, I researched Big Data trends and publish articles on KDnuggets.com. I also do integration, mining and analysis of data from multiple sources such as social media (Twitter and LinkedIn) and web analytics for customer insights. Besides, I have developed interactive data visualization to assist quick progress from observing issue to root cause identification.

                                                Named Data Networking(NDN) at UCLA
                                                Since May 2012, I have been actively involved in the research and development of a new, better architecture for internet – Named Data Networking (NDN) at UCLA REMAP (Center for Research in Engineering, Media and Performance). The fundamental changes introduced by NDN to the internet communication paradigm call for extensive and multi-dimensional evaluations of various aspects of the NDN design, which comprised of majority of my work at UCLA.During my research, I built several modules that facilitate the use and assessment of NDN framework for real-life innovative applications such as server-less multi-user chat and environmental sensing.  I used these modules to do performance assessment and benchmarking of key components of the NDN architecture. The insights provided by my analysis led to the identification of architecture gaps, thus, providing direction to future research. My research and consequently developed applications clearly demonstrated how NDN’s embedding of application names in the routing system promotes efficient authoring of sophisticated distributed applications, reducing complexity and thus opportunities for error, as well as time and expense of design and deployment.

                                                Side-match prediction based intra-coding method for H.264/AVC
                                                Implemented and integrateda side-matchprediction scheme into the state-of-the-art H.264/AVC framework to provide a new predictive approach. The proposed method generates a side-match predicted image from original image through the process of side match prediction. Side match prediction uses the neighboring known pixels to predict an unknownpixel.The prediction error sub-image generated by subtracting the side-match prediction image from original image is then encoded with intra prediction modes, quantization parameters and, scanning patterns.
