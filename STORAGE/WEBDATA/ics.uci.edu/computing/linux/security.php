Linux Security




With the power and flexibility of UNIX and UNIX variants like Linux
come many potential security holes.  To limit the vulnerability of your
workstation as well as that of the system, please read the following 
suggestions
and apply the patches appropriate to your particular version
of Linux.

General Advice
 Use a current version of your version of Linux. For 
example,
              Red Hat 5.1 is known to be particularly favored by 
hackers.  Apply security 
 patches  as soon
              as they become available. As soon as a vulnerability 
becomes known,
              attack kits are posted on the Internet to take advantage 
of it.  Turn off 
 services you do not need.
              Most versions of Linux come with preconfigured options 
enabled
              for things that most people never use. Many of these are 
popular
              targets for attack.  Look into available 
 tools to
              prevent break-ins to your workstation. ﻿﻿﻿﻿Keep track of your logs for repeated access attempt or other unusual activity. These log files are usually located in the /var/log directory.
