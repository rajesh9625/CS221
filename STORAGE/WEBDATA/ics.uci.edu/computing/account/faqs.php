I am enrolled in an ICS course, why can't I get an account?
Our system is linked to the UCI registrar's 
database, and we receive updates once a
          	day.  If your classes were dropped because you have not paid 
your fees, you will not be eligible for an account
          	until your fees are paid.  If you are adding a class, please wait overnight to ensure that we get the updated 
information.
          	
Where do I go to log in?
Students taking ICS classes may access the ICS labs located on the
            1st and 3rd floors of the Computer Science building.  Check 
the Lab Information page for information on lab locations, 
operating hours, and hardware and software specifications.
            Note that these labs are not "public" labs in the sense that
 they are only for students taking ICS
            courses.
