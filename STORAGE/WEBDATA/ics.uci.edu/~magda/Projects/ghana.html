GhanaGhana Slave Trade





 Research Abstract

The story of the slave trade is not often told to the masses, the world
over, in its entirety, beginning from the villages in the heart of the
African continent and ending on the shores of the New World. This
project proposes to create a learning experience using virtual world
technology that will bring the slave trade experience from its origins
the West Coast of Africa

Motivation 

The motivation for this virtual tour project - for making the history
of the slave trade come alive, is to give true meaning to the proverb:
``let us forgive but let us never forget.’’ By creating a virtual
environment that renders the story of the slave trade, from its origins
on the Western Coast of Africa, to its final destinations on the shores
of the western side of the Atlantic, with a near to realistic
experience of the journey suffered by so many, we will foster a
stronger appreciation and understanding of one of history’s most
shameful eras. A virtual 3D immersive tour will

•    spark the interest of our children and youth as
they learn about it in school,

•    serve as a valuable tool for historians and
scholars the world over, and 

•    make the history of the African slave trade
accessible to all.
