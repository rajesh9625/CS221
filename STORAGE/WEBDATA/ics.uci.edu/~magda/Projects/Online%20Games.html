Online GamesOnline Games and Virtual Environments (VE)


It is believed that online games and
VEs will become the pervasive “3D web” or “3D Internet” that will
enable real-time interactions and to access information, in a way that
we cannot do with the current 2D web. By making 3D immersive
environments well integrated with everyday computing activities, it
becomes possible to develop engaging new applications for Science,
Education and Health that can reach the widest audiences possible.
The large-scale virtual environments
of tomorrow have to be sufficiently flexible (to support varied
environments), powerful (to not limit functionality to the least common
denominator), and extensible (to support decades of continued
evolution, much as the Internet and Web have). MMVEs will have a
tremendous impact on the way the Internet will evolve in the future due
to their interactive and real-time nature. Online computer
gaming/simulation is forecasted to become one of the most demanding
applications on the Internet. Researchers in the networking arena need
to be prepared to meet that challenge, and our success will depend very
much on how well we understand the requirements of this new class of
applications.
With the anticipated growth in this
application area, we will be seeing more and more stress being placed
on the underlying transport infrastructure to provide the kind of
quality of experience (QoE) that these applications and their users
expect. The quality of an end user’s experience is the true litmus test
of a proper online game deployment. Only by understanding both the
application needs and the underlying network facilities can one design
networking mechanisms and develop pre and post processing schemes to
ensure the required QoE. The next section gives an overview of some
recent work that I have conducted and plan to continue pursuing in QoE.
