                I am currently perusing a Ph.D at the University of California, Irvine in the Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences. My advisor is Prof. Sharad Mehrotra.
                
                My focus is on problems that relate to the management, extraction and fusion of information from multiple media sources. This area relates the the following established fields: databases and data management, time series data management, statistical databases, model building and classification applied in the context of media (text,image,video) processing. 
                
                The Ph.D dissertation deals with the issues related to the data management support for sentient systems, for various first responding and life preserving applications funded by NSF’s ITR-Rescue (RESponding to Crisis and Unexpected Events) and DHS’s Safire (Situational Awareness for Firefighters).
                
                A unique approach where hidden semantics, such as statistical dependencies between events, are exploited to enhance the ability to accurately perform event detection from sensors (see MMCN’08 recalibration paper) or scheduling data collection from a large sensor network for the purpose of event detection (see MMCN’09 scheduling paper).
                The work is motivated by real-world emergency-response application needs and will contribute significantly to the emergency-responder’s ability to react to crisis and unexpected events.
                
                Before I joined Prof. Sharad Mehrotra's research group, I had worked with Prof. Ehud Gudes and Dr. Yuval Elovici for 2 years, the main research topic is secure data management, specifically: database encryption. My previous research experience includes Private and Secure data management, efficient service oriented processing on untrusted co-processors (see master's Thesis and Patent).
