  About
  My interests include statistics, machine learning, distributed systems, information visualization, and functional programming.

I hail from western Colorado. My undergraduate degree in Mathematics is from Reed College in Portland, Oregon. During college I studied abroad through the Budapest Semesters in Mathematics program. Between schools I worked in the private sector, notably co-founding a natural language analytics startup, Lucky Sort.
