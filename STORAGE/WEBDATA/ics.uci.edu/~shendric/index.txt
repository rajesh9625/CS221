                I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine.
                I'm pursuing a Ph.D. under the direction of Richard N. Taylor.

                Modeling and Evolving Product Line Architectures
                My primary research focus is on modeling and evolving software product line architectures (PLAs) using change sets and relationships. In a nutshell, the approach stores sets of architectural 
  modifications within selectable change sets, which when merged in to an architecture 
                modify it by adding or removing features. Individual products are composed by merging together a selection of change sets. Dependencies, conflicts, and variant relationships between
                the change sets are modeled explicitly using relationships to guide an architect in creating only desired product compositions. This work was published as  Modeling Product Line Architectures through Change Sets and Relationships and evolved from previous work on exploring design alternatives using a layer-based approach towards modeling designs, see Layered Class Diagrams: Supporting the Design Process and Towards Supporting the Architecture Design Process Through Evaluation of Design Alternatives.
                As an undergraduate and during the first few years of grad school, I focused on capturing and presenting causal relationships between events  fired within asynchronous architecture, see An Approach for Tracing and Understanding Asynchronous Architectures. I've also done some work on architectural styles PACE: An Architectural Style for Trust Management in Decentralized Applications.Publications

                What's Important
                I'm pretty crazy about my family. There's nothing like playing with your kids after a stressful day!
                On Sundays, you'll find me here running sound, PowerPoint, or just hanging out.
