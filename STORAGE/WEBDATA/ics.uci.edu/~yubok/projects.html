        Regulation in Online Games
        Regulating people's behavior has been a challenging problem on the Internet,although cyber libertarians would argue against the 
        	regulation of the Internet. Lessig categorizes regulatory forces into norms, law, market and code. He believes that these four 
        	means can work together to reach an optimal mix in terms of regulatory efficiency.Yet nowadays new, hybrid regulatory regimes emerge, 
        	which do not belong to any single Lessigian category. For example, the Tribunal in League of Legends involves the comminity in policing 
        	itself, eBay court leverages crowdsourcing to resolute online dispute.How do these new regimes impact people's social life?
