gg_wald: closed-form Wald
tests for genome-wide analysis of gene-gene interactions

 

gg_wald
is a C++ program that conducts Wald tests for testing gene-gene interactions.

 

Benefits
of gg_wald:

o   Feasible for genome-wide
interaction analysis. It runs as fast as other computationally efficient tests
of gene-gene interactions

o   Flexible parameterization. It
can conduct both 4-degree-of-freedom and 1-degree-of-freedom tests. Tests with
other parameterization, such as dominant or recessive interaction effects, can
be obtained by slightly modifying the source code 

o   Statistically valid. The results
are based upon Wald tests, which are asymptotically equivalent to likelihood
ratio tests.
