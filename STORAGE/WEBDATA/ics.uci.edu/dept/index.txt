Departments




The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences is comprised of three departments that teach the broad foundation of each discipline but allow students the flexibility to explore many areas of computer science with carefully crafted curriculums that appeal to students’ diverse interests.
Computer Science Department
  
The Department of Computer Science engages in the full spectrum of intellectual activity in computer science, ranging from fundamental theoretical principles, to design and analysis of computer systems and networks, to new and exciting applications in areas as diverse as bioinformatics and computer security.


Informatics Department 
The Department of Informatics focuses on the interdisciplinary study of the design, application, use and impacts of information technology.
  
  
  Statistics Department

The new Department of Statistics, which officially joined ICS in July 2003, has core strength in statistical theory with a focus on statistical methods for solving interdisciplinary problems.
