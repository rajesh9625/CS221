<h1>ICS 169B &mdash; Capstone Game Project II</h1>
<center><h3>Winter, 2016</h3></center>

<h2>Syllabus</h2>

<p>
In this course, and its first part ICS 169A,
students work in teams to design and develop a computer game.

<p>
The course has no textbook, tests, or final exam.
The final exam period, Tuesday, March 15, from 4:00pm to 6:00pm will be
used for final presentations.

<p>
ICS 169A and 169B are graded together; your grade for ICS 169B will "count"
for both courses.
The grade for ICS 169B will be determined as follows:
<blockquote>
<b>80%: Game quality and individual contribution to the game</b>, where "quality" includes
				many but probably not all of
	<li>Good gameplay - well balanced, fun, challenging but not too hard, engaging, replayable, immersive, addictive
	<li>Art and art design, including animation - polished, integrated with theme and gameplay
	<li>Music and sound design - polished, integrated with theme and gameplay
	<li><i>(Note: credit is given for art and sound assets created by team members, and for the work
			required to wrangle external artists and their creations)</i>
	<li>Completeness - such as menus, ending screens, transitions between levels, save/restore,
			help screens and tutorial levels, cut scenes, GUI elements
	<li>Technical challenges - such as complex AI, networking
	<li>Extensiveness - multiple levels/quests/puzzles, many characters, weapons, attacks, etc.
	<li>Narrative - background story, integration with game play, good writing and proofreading
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>20%: Course process</b>, including
	<li>Attendance
	<li>Completing surveys
	<li>Timely completion of weekly status reports
</blockquote>

<!--
<ul>
<li>10%, attendance during lecture periods
<li>20%, participation at team meetings
<li>40%, weekly status reports
<li>30%, team progress on the game
</ul>
<p>
The tentative Fall quarter grade will be weighted as 45% of the overall grade.

*Visit from UCSC's game program: UC Santa Cruz has
<a href="https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/graduate-study">several options</a> for graduate study in games.
After a brief outline of those options from Prof. Jim Whitehead, Michael John, the Program Director for the
Games and Playable Media MS program, will give a talk.  Here's the abstract:

<blockquote>

<b>Dynamic tuning, game analytics, and purple dragons, ca. 1999</b>
<p>

In 1999, the teams of Insomniac Games and Universal Interactive Studios had successfully
launched Spyro the Dragon, with the help of Sony, and we realized we had found success at
our goal of reaching a very large and diverse audience. However, this came at a cost -
tuning the difficulty of the game was extremely difficult, and resulted in a game that
was not correct for any particular cohort of the audience.
<p>

As we developed Spyro 2, we added a system which would adjust the difficulty of the play
experience on-the-fly according to the player's historical performance. However as we
attempted to seed the system with performance metrics, we realized we needed more accuracy
than we could get from simple observation. So we implemented a primitive data analytics
system into the pre-release builds of Spyro 2 and gathered play performance data from
our playtesters.
<p>

Both of these systems were created out of pure necessity, but ended up being well ahead of
their time. I'll detail our thought processes in how they were created, show some of the
data we collected and how it was used, and talk about how adaptive difficulty is at work
in a great many of the games you play, whether you know it or not.
