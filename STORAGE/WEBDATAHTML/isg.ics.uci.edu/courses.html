We will cover the entity relationship (E/R) approach to database design. We will cover the relational data model, mapping E/R designs to relations, relational design theory, abstract query language such as relational algebra, and programming in SQL. Students will get exposure to how relational database management systems are used to implement a database. Time permitting, we will also consider advanced database management features such as object-oriented and object-relational database systems. This course is aimed at database design and use of database management systems in implementing database applications.</p><h3 id="CS122B"><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs122b/">CS122B: Projects in Database Management and Web Applications</a></h3>Fall 2011 / Spring 2012<span> - </span><a xmlns="" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~chenli/">Prof. Li</a><p>This course exposes students to advanced programming concepts and
provides students with a greater focus on using DBMS techniques to
build Web-based applications. It is intended for two purposes: (1) It
introduces students to the modern data management techniques including
database connectivity, Web application development, extending database
functions, database administration, and XML. (2) It teaches students
how to use these technologies to build real-world applications. The
course builds on  CS122A, which introduces students to the classical
relational databases and SQL programming.

Multimedia is becoming the common mode of synchronous, asynchronous, local, and remote communication. Most of the current assisted communication technologies use single medium. Adoption of multimedia has significant social implications. More relevant to this course, it has significant opportunity for technology development.

Multimedia computing and communication systems started receiving attention more than a decade ago. Naturally, early systems dealt with very limited aspect of multimedia. With progress in technology, we will have to address several computing and communication issues in dealing with creation, communication, storage, access, and presentation of multimedia. In this course, we will discuss fundamentals of multimedia systems and address emerging issues that are being addressed as well as should be addressed. In discussing topics, our emphasis will be on concepts and fundamentals.</p><h3 id="CS222"><a href="https://grape.ics.uci.edu/wiki/asterix/wiki/cs222-2011-fall">CS222: Principles of Database Management</a></h3>Fall 2011<span> - </span><a xmlns="" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mjcarey/">Prof. Carey</a><p>This course provides an implementor's view of database management systems. It covers fundamental principles and implementation techniques, issues, and trade-offs related to database management systems. Topics covered include storage management, buffer management, record-oriented file systems, access methods, query optimization, and query processing,. This course is a must for those students wishing to explore database management as an area of research and/or who plan on taking CS223 or CS224. A significant portion of database systems research as well as industrial database and information system development deals with adapting the basic database techniques covered in this course to new advances in hardware and software technologies or to the requirements of different applications and data types.</p><h3 id="CS223"><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs223/">CS223: Transaction Processing and Distributed Data Management</a></h3>Winter 2011<span> - </span> <a xmlns="" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sharad/">Prof. Mehrotra</a><p>The course covers fundamental principles underlying transaction processing including database consistency, concurrency control, database recovery and fault-tolerance. The course includes transaction processing in centralized, distributed, parallel, and client-server environments. It also covers distributed database systems. The course is a prerequisite for further advanced data management courses and research principles of data management.</p><h3 id="CS224"><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs224/">CS224: Advances in Database Management System Technology </a></h3>Spring 2011<span> - </span><a xmlns="" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sharad/">Prof. Mehrotra</a><p>This course covers selected topics in advanced database research.

    	 related to the field. The course will begin with some initial all-hands reading, lectures, and perhaps exercises involving MapReduce and Hadoop as well
    	  as UCI's own ASTERIX software. Students will then spend the bulk of the course taking a much deeper dive into some particular aspect of data-intensive
    	   computing that interests them. Students from fields like machine learning or social science may wish to explore the application of data-intensive 
    	   computing techniques to problems in their area; students interested in programming languages may choose to compare (hands-on!) several alternative 
    	   data-intensive languages and/or platforms; students interested in data management techniques may wish to benchmark new storage technologies 
    	   (e.g., some of the emerging "NoSQL stores") or to spend the quarter working as an extension of the ASTERIX development team by adding new types 
    	   and functions, operators, and/or storage features to the ASTERIX/Hyracks platform under development at UCI.</p><h3 id="CS295"><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/CS295.html ">CS295: Information Quality and Entity resolution</a></h3>Fall 2010<span> - </span><a xmlns="" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/">Prof. Kalashnikov</a><p>The effectiveness of data-driven technologies as decision support tools, data exploration and scientific discovery tools is closely tied to the
quality of data on which such techniques are applied. It is well recognized that the outcome of the analysis is only as good as the quality of data on which the analysis is performed. That is why today organizations spend a tangible percent of their budgets on cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates, correcting errors, filling missing values, to improve data quality prior to pushing data through the analysis pipeline. The objective of this course is to deepen our understanding of recent trends in data quality research. The course focuses specifically, but not exclusively, on data management techniques for solving Entity Resolution (ER) problem. The ER challenge arises because objects in the real world are referred to using references or descriptions that are not always unique identifiers of the objects, leading to ambiguity. This ambiguity must be resolved, or taken into account, when analyzing the data to produce meaningful results. The course is based on student presentations of prominent recent publications in the area of information quality.</p><h3 id="CS295">CS295: Middleware for Mobile and Pervasive Computing</h3><p>TBD</p><h3 id="CS295">CS295: ENTREPRENEURSHIP</h3>Winter 2011<span> - </span><a xmlns="" href="http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/">Prof. Jain</a><p>TBD</p><div class="gotop"><a href="#header">^ top</a></div></div><div id="footer"><p>Last Updated on January 07, 2011</p></div></div></body></html>
