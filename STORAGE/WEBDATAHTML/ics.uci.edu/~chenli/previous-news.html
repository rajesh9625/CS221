Prof. Mike Carey
has <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/press/view_press?id=73">joined
our department</a>.

<li> (7/3/2008) <b>Launching Search@ICS</b>: I am glad to our research
prototype has been launched on the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu">ICS
Homepage</a> that can support interactive, fuzzy search for ICS people and
general pages at ICS.UCI.EDU.

<li> (4/1/2008) <b>Launching PSearch</b>: I am glad to release

 and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs224">CS224</a>.

<li> (2/22/2008) <b>New SIGMOD08 paper</b>: The conference has accepted
our paper titled "Cost-Based Variable-Length-Gram Selection for String Collections to
Support Approximate Queries Efficiently", a joint work with Bin Wang and Xiaochun
Yang when they visited our place last fall.  The paper solves several open,
important problems not addressed in our VLDB07 VGRAM paper.

<li> (2/1/2008) <b>New Visitor</b>: I am glad that <a
href="http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ligl/">Guoliang Li</a> from

<li> (12/12/2007) Today I attended a local computer industry forum 
about the computer cluster workforce in Orange County.  There is
an excellent <a href="docs/oc-workworce-computer-survey2007.pdf">survey</a>
on the needs of computer cluster workforce in the county.  One interesting
finding is that the county is facing the challenge of not being able
to find enough workers in the IT industry.  The survey also gives
us some thoughts on how we design our education curriculum to meet the
need of the industry.



<li> (12/2007) I am looking for a motivated BS/MS student for an
  independent research project.  Requirements: strong java
  programming skills.  Please contact me if you are interested.

<li> (10/2007) <b>New paper on approximate string matching</b>: Our
  recent paper titled "Efficient Merging and Filtering Algorithms for
  Approximate String Searches" by Chen Li, Jiaheng Lu, and Yiming Lu
  will appear in ICDE 2008. We developed new algorithms and indexing
  structures that can significantly improve the performance of
  approximate string search.

<li> (10/2007) <b>New NSF Grant</b>: We received an NSF grant of $95K
for our proposal titled "SGER: Answering Approximate String Queries
Using Variable-Length Grams."

this is the largest support I received from the industry.

<li>(7/2006) <b>Work on Data Exchange</b>: Recently I finished a
technical report with Foto Afrati and Vassia Pavlaki (at NTUA, Greece)
titled "Data Exchange with Arithmetic Comparisons."  It is a work we
have been working on for almost one year: all of us went to Stanford
for one week, and Vassia visited UCI twice. It took us a lot of time
to think about all the subtle issues that are not covered in the <a
href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1085309&dl=ACM&coll=ACM&CFID=15151515&CFTOKEN=6184618">excellent
paper on data exchange</a> by Fagin et al.  I am glad that finally we
completed the work, and I really like it.

<li>(6/2006) <b>Summer</b>: My student, Ray, is doing a summer internship at
Yahoo!.  My other students are working with me during the summer.  I
will have two visitors (Xiaochun Yang and Bin Wang).
I will visit a few places (IBM, SRI,
Yahoo, Google, possibly Toronto, and VLDB in Korea).  Well, these will
keep me busy enough, not to mention I have two sons to play with :-)

Selection Queries</a> (joint work with Nick Koudas, Anthony Tung, and
my student, Rares Vernica) will appear in VLDB 2006, Seoul, Korea.  It
is about how to relax empty-answer SQL queries in RDBMS in order to
compute answers for users with a minimal relaxation.  We use skyline
as our relaxation framework, in which we need to consider join
conditions as well.  The work extends our previous work on supporting
approximate query answering in applications such as data cleaning.
See our two VLDB'2005 papers on similar topics.

<li> (5/2006) <b>CleanDB Workshop</b>: I am currently organizing the
<a href="http://pike.psu.edu/cleandb06/">CleanDB Workshop</a> with <a
