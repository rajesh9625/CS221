        <div class="sectionHeader">About Me</div>
        <p>I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="http://www.informatics.uci.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Informatics</a>,
        <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/" target="_blank">Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science</a>,
        <a href="http://www.uci.edu/" target="_blank">the University of California, Irvine</a>. My advisor is 
        <a href="http://luci.ics.uci.edu/LUCIinterface.html#bioFaculty&djp3" target="_blank">Professor Donald J. Patterson</a>. 
        My research interests are human computer interaction (HCI) and ubiquitous computing.
	I am particularly interested in technologies and issues that improve the quality of life for people living with impaired 
	abilities due to illness or aging. If there is anything you want to discuss or share, please feel free to reach me
        through one of the means listed in the <a href="#contact">"Contact"</a> section.
        </p>
	<p>Before coming to UC Irvine, I was a web developer in New Zealand.</p>

        I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with Honors at the <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/" target="_blank">
        Department of Computer Science</a>,
        <a  href="http://www.auckland.ac.nz" target="_blank">the University of Auckland</a>.
	My Honor dissertation supervisor was <a href="http://cs.auckland.ac.nz/~beryl/" target="_blank">Dr. Beryl Plimmer</a>. At UC Irvine,
	I have been working with <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kobsa/" target="_blank">Professor Alfred Kobsa</a>
	and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~yunanc/Yunan_Chen/about_me.html" target="_blank">Professor Yunan Chen</a>
	on <a href="#project">diabetes patient personal management tools</a>. I am also working with 
	<a href="http://luci.ics.uci.edu/LUCIinterface.html#bioFaculty&djp3" target="_blank">Professor Donald J. Patterson</a> 
	on <a href="#project">another project</a> where we explore
	 the role of context in information sharing.

		    <div class="subTitle">Using Geofencing to Improve the Performance of Location-based Services</div>
		    <div>Geofencing is a functionatlity that has become available in all popular mobile platforms. In this project, we took advantage of its proactive
		     nature and created location-based services that reduce power consumption of mobile user agents. 
		    </div>

		    <div class="subTitle">Context-awareness in Information Sharing</div>
		    <div>With the progress in information technology, we are facing the challenge of information overflow. However, people's information needs are often
		    context specific. In this project, we aim to improve the understanding of roles that context-awareness plays in information management.

		    <div class="subTitle">Personal Rules in Diabetes Self-management</div>
		    <div>Website: <a href="http://informatics-study.ics.uci.edu/" target="_blank">HealthWatch</a></div>
		    <div>One important part of diabetes self-management is to see the patterns between diet, exercise and glucose levels. Experienced patients apply this knowledge to control their sugar levels and minimize the use of insulin injection. In this project, we aim to create systems that assist such a practise. This ongoing project is supervised by Professor Alfred Kobsa, Professor Yunan Chen (both from Informatics, UC Irvine), and Professor Dara Sorkin (School of Medicine, UC Irinve). I am actively involved in designing the study, developing the software prototypes, data collection, and data analysis. </div>
		</li>
		<li>
		    <div class="subTitle">Clinical Information on a Timeline</div>
		    <div>Accumulated patient information from various sources over time can be hard to decode. Clinicians need to see the relation among events to hypothesize or verify theories. Temporal relations are useful clues for such an analysis. In this project, we conducted user studies and participatory design to explore requirements for a web system that visualizes temporal events. This ongoing project is supervised by Professor Wendy Chapman and Professor Robert El-Kareh (both from iDash, UC San Diego). As a 2012 summer intern, I was involved in the design and development of a prototype web system used in the study. </div>
