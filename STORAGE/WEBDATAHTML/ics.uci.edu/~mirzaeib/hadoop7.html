<p><a id="idx10738" class="epub__indexterm"></a><a id="idx10739" class="epub__indexterm"></a>Early versions of Hadoop assumed that HDFS and MapReduce
    clusters would be used by a group of cooperating users within a secure
    environment. The measures for restricting access were designed to prevent
    accidental data loss, rather than to prevent unauthorized access to data.
    For example, the file permissions system in HDFS prevents one user from
    accidentally wiping out the whole filesystem from a bug in a program, or
    by mistakenly typing <code class="epub__literal">hadoop fs -rmr /</code>,
    but it doesn’t prevent a malicious user from assuming root’s identity (see
    <a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/9781449328917/id2572159#I_sidebar5_d1e9874" class="epub__xref" title="Setting User Identity" data-ajax="1">Setting User Identity</a>) to access or delete any data in the
    cluster.</p>
<p>In security parlance, what was missing was a secure <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31472" class="epub__indexterm"></a><em class="epub__firstterm">authentication</em> mechanism to assure
    Hadoop that the user seeking to perform an operation on the cluster is who
    she claims to be and therefore can be trusted. HDFS file permissions
    provide only a mechanism for <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31478" class="epub__indexterm"></a><em class="epub__firstterm">authorization</em>, which controls what a
    particular user can do to a particular file. For example, a file may be readable only by a
    certain group of users, so anyone not in that group is not authorized to
    read it. However, authorization is not enough by itself, because the
    system is still open to abuse via spoofing by a malicious user who can
    gain network access to the cluster.</p>
<p>It’s common to restrict access to data that contains personally
    identifiable information (such as an end user’s full name or IP address)
    to a small set of users (of the cluster) within the organization who are
    authorized to access such information. Less sensitive (or anonymized) data
    may be made available to a larger set of users. It is convenient to host a
    mix of datasets with different security levels on the same cluster (not
    least because it means the datasets with lower security levels can be
    shared). However, to meet regulatory requirements for data protection,
    secure authentication must be in place for shared clusters.</p>
<p>This is the situation that Yahoo! faced in 2009, which led a team of
    engineers there to implement secure authentication for Hadoop. In their
    design, Hadoop itself does not manage user credentials; instead, it relies
    on Kerberos, a mature open-source network authentication protocol, to
    authenticate the user. In turn, Kerberos doesn’t manage permissions.
    Kerberos says that a user is who he says he is; it’s Hadoop’s job to
    determine whether that user has permission to perform a given action.
    There’s a lot to Kerberos, so here we only cover enough to use it in the
    context of Hadoop, referring readers who want more background to <span class="epub__italic"><a class="epub__ulink" href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596004033/" target="_new">Kerberos: The Definitive

</div>

</div>

<p>The authorization and service request steps are not user-level
      actions; the client performs these steps on the user’s behalf. The
      authentication step, however, is normally carried out explicitly by the
      user using the <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31571" class="epub__indexterm"></a><code class="epub__literal">kinit</code> command, which
      will prompt for a password. However, this doesn’t mean you need to enter
      your password every time you run a job or access HDFS, since TGTs last
      for 10 hours by default (and can be renewed for up to a week). It’s
      common to automate authentication at operating system login time,
      thereby providing <em class="epub__firstterm">single sign-on</em> to
      Hadoop.</p>
<p>In cases where you don’t want to be prompted for a password (for
      running an unattended MapReduce
      job, for example), you can create a Kerberos
      <em class="epub__firstterm">keytab</em> file using the <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31588" class="epub__indexterm"></a><code class="epub__literal">ktutil</code> command. A
      keytab is a file that stores passwords and may be supplied to <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31594" class="epub__indexterm"></a><code class="epub__literal">kinit</code> with the <code class="epub__literal">-t</code> option.</p>

<div>
<h3 class="epub__title"><a id="id568403"></a>An example</h3>
</div>

</div>


</div>
<p>Let’s look at an example of the process in action. The first
        step is to enable Kerberos authentication by setting the <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31609" class="epub__indexterm"></a><code class="epub__literal">hadoop.security.authentication</code> property in
        <em class="epub__filename">core-site.xml</em> to <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31618" class="epub__indexterm"></a><code class="epub__literal">kerberos</code>.<sup>[<a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/9781449328917/id2466321#ftn.id684220" id="id684220" class="epub__footnote" data-ajax="1">80</a>]</sup> The default setting is <code class="epub__literal">simple</code>, which signifies that the old backwards-compatible (but insecure)
        behavior of using the operating system user name to determine identity
        should be employed.</p>
<p>We also need to enable service-level authorization by setting
        <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31641" class="epub__indexterm"></a><code class="epub__literal">hadoop.security.authorization</code> to <code class="epub__literal">true</code> in the same file. You may configure
        Access Control Lists (ACLs) in the <em class="epub__filename">hadoop-policy.xml</em> configuration file to
        control which users and groups have permission to connect to each
        Hadoop service. Services are defined at the protocol level, so there
        are ones for MapReduce job submission, namenode communication, and so
        on. By default, all ACLs are set to <code class="epub__literal">*</code>, which means that all users have
        permission to access each service, but on a real cluster you should
        lock the ACLs down to only those users and groups that should have
        access.</p>
<p>The format for an ACL is a comma-separated list of usernames,
        followed by whitespace, followed by a comma-separated list of group
        names. For example, the ACL <code class="epub__literal">preston,howard directors,inventors</code>
        would authorize access to users named <code class="epub__literal">preston</code> or <code class="epub__literal">howard</code>, or in groups <code class="epub__literal">directors</code> or <code class="epub__literal">inventors</code>.</p>
<p>With Kerberos authentication turned on, let’s see what happens
        when we try to copy a local file to HDFS:</p>
<pre class="epub__screen"><code class="epub__prompt">%</code> <strong class="epub__userinput"><code>hadoop fs -put quangle.txt .</code></strong>
10/07/03 15:44:58 WARN ipc.Client: Exception encountered while connecting to the
server: javax.security.sasl.SaslException: GSS initiate failed [Caused by GSSEx
ception: No valid credentials provided (Mechanism level: Failed to find any Ker

tion: GSS initiate failed [Caused by GSSException: No valid credentials provided
(Mechanism level: Failed to find any Kerberos tgt)]</pre>
<p>The operation fails because we don’t have a Kerberos ticket. We
        can get one by authenticating to the KDC, using <code class="epub__literal">kinit</code>:</p>
<pre class="epub__screen"><code class="epub__prompt">%</code> <strong class="epub__userinput"><code>kinit</code></strong>

<code class="epub__prompt">%</code> <strong class="epub__userinput"><code>hadoop fs -stat %n quangle.txt</code></strong>
quangle.txt</pre>
<p>And we see that the file is successfully written to HDFS. Notice
        that even though we carried out two filesystem commands, we only
        needed to call <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31712" class="epub__indexterm"></a><code class="epub__literal">kinit</code> once, since the
        Kerberos ticket is valid for 10 hours (use the <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31718" class="epub__indexterm"></a><code class="epub__literal">klist</code> command to see
        the expiry time of your tickets and <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31724" class="epub__indexterm"></a><code class="epub__literal">kdestroy</code> to
        invalidate your tickets). After we get a ticket, everything works just
        as it normally would.<a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31730" class="epub__indexterm"></a><a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31732" class="epub__indexterm"></a><a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31733" class="epub__indexterm"></a></p>

<p><a id="idx10743" class="epub__indexterm"></a><a id="idx10744" class="epub__indexterm"></a><a id="idx10745" class="epub__indexterm"></a>In a distributed system such as HDFS or MapReduce, there
      are many client-server interactions, each of which must be
      authenticated. For example, an HDFS read operation will involve multiple
      calls to the namenode and calls to one or more datanodes. Instead of
      using the three-step Kerberos ticket exchange protocol to authenticate
      each call, which would present a high load on the KDC on a busy cluster,
      Hadoop uses <em class="epub__firstterm">delegation tokens</em> to allow later
      authenticated access without having to contact the KDC again. Delegation
      tokens are created and used transparently by Hadoop on behalf of users,
      so there’s no action you need to take as a user beyond using <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31757" class="epub__indexterm"></a><code class="epub__literal">kinit</code> to sign in, but
      it’s useful to have a basic idea of how they are used.</p>
<p>A delegation token is generated by the server (the namenode in
      this case) and can be thought of as a shared secret between the client
      and the server. On the first RPC call to the namenode, the client has no
      delegation token, so it uses Kerberos to authenticate, and as a part of
      the response it gets a delegation token from the namenode. In subsequent
      calls, it presents the delegation token, which the namenode can verify
      (since it generated it using a secret key), and hence the client is
      authenticated to the server.</p>
<p>When it wants to perform operations on HDFS blocks, the client
      uses a special kind of delegation token, called a <em class="epub__firstterm">block
      access token</em>, that the namenode passes to the client in
      response to a metadata request. The client uses the block access token
      to authenticate itself to datanodes. This is possible only because the
      namenode shares its secret key used to generate the block access token
      with datanodes (which it sends in heartbeat messages), so that they can
      verify block access tokens. Thus, an HDFS block may be accessed only by
      a client with a valid block access token from a namenode. This closes
      the security hole in unsecured Hadoop where only the block ID was needed
      to gain access to a block. This property is enabled by setting
      <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31770" class="epub__indexterm"></a><code class="epub__literal">dfs.block.access.token.enable</code> to <code class="epub__literal">true</code>.</p>
<p>In MapReduce, job resources and metadata (such as JAR files, input
      splits, and configuration files) are shared in HDFS for the jobtracker
      to access, and user code runs on the tasktrackers and accesses files on
      HDFS (the process is explained in <a href="http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/9781449328917/id2438152#AnatomyOfAMapReduceJobRun" class="epub__xref" title="Anatomy of a MapReduce Job Run" data-ajax="1">Anatomy of a MapReduce Job Run</a>). Delegation tokens are used by
      the jobtracker and tasktrackers to access HDFS during the course of the
      job. When the job has finished, the delegation tokens are
      invalidated.</p>
<p>Delegation tokens are automatically obtained for the default HDFS
      instance,
      but if your job needs to access other HDFS clusters, you can load the
      delegation tokens for these by setting the <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31788" class="epub__indexterm"></a><code class="epub__literal">mapreduce.job.hdfs-servers</code> job property to a
      comma-separated list of HDFS

          they can’t send signals to each other (to kill another user’s tasks,

          data stored in the cluster. This is enforced by requiring daemons to
          authenticate with the master node they are connecting to.</p>
<p>To enable this feature, you first need to configure Hadoop to
          use a keytab previously generated with the <a id="I_indexterm9_d1e31893" class="epub__indexterm"></a><code class="epub__literal">ktutil</code> command. For

<p>One area that hasn’t yet been addressed in the security work is
      encryption: neither RPC nor block transfers are encrypted. HDFS blocks
      are not stored in an encrypted form either. These features are planned
      for a future release, and in fact, encrypting the data stored in HDFS
      could be carried out in existing versions of Hadoop by the application
