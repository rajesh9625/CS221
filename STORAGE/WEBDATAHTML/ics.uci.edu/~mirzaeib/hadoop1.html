</div>

</div>


</div>
<p>This chapter explains how to set up Hadoop to run on a cluster of
  machines. Running HDFS and MapReduce on a single machine is great for
  learning about these systems, but to do useful work they need to run on
  multiple nodes.</p>
<p>There are a few options when it comes to getting a Hadoop cluster,
  from building your own, to running on rented hardware or using an offering
  that provides Hadoop as a service in the cloud. This chapter and the next
  give you enough information to set up and operate your own cluster, but even
  if you are using a Hadoop service in which a lot of the routine maintenance
  is done for you, these chapters still offer valuable information about how
  Hadoop works from an operations point of view.</p>
