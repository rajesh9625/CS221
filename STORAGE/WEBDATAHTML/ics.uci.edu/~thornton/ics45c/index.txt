      <p>Welcome!  Please note a couple of things as we get started this quarter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first lecture will meet on Thursday, September 24.  There are no scheduled lab sections, but we will have informal lab meetings, with times and dates to be announced early in the quarter, but likely to begin sometime during Week 1.  For more information about meeting times of lab meetings, see the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>.  For information about lecture material and readings, see the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>.</li>
        <li>I encourage you to spend some time reading through the material on the course web site.  It will be updated periodically throughout the quarter, and there will always be an announcement here describing each update.  For now, notice the set of links at the top of this (and every) page, leading you to the <a href="CourseReference.html">Course Reference</a>, the <a href="Schedule.html">Schedule</a>, and the <a href="ProjectGuide">Project Guide</a>, as well as a set of <a href="NotesAndExamples">Notes and Examples</a> &mdash; mostly emanating from the lectures &mdash; that will be posted throughout the quarter.</li>
