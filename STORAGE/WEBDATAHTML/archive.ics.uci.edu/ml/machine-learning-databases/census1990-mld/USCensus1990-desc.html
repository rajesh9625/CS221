<p>Multivariate</p>

<H2> Abstract</H2>
<p>
The USCensus1990 data set is a discretized version of the
<a href="USCensus1990raw.html">USCensus1990raw</a>
 data set. Many of the less useful attributes in the
original data set have been dropped, the few continuous variables have
been discretized and the few discrete variables that have a large
number of possible values have been collapsed to have fewer possible
values.
</p>
<H2>Sources</H2>
<p>
<p>
The USCensus1990raw data set was obtained from the (U.S. Department of
Commerce) Census Bureau website using the Data Extraction System. This
system can be found at
<a href="http://www.census.gov/DES/www/des.html">http://www.census.gov/DES/www/d

<H2>Data Characteristics</H2>
<p>
The data was collected as part of the 1990 census.
</p>
<p>
There are 68 categorical attributes. This data set was derived from
the USCensus1990raw data set. The attributes are listed in the file
USCensus1990.attributes.txt (repeated below) and the coding for the
values is described below.  Many of the less useful attributes in the
original data set have been dropped, the few continuous variables have
been discretized and the few discrete variables that have a large
number of possible values have been collapsed to have fewer possible
values.
</p>
<p>
   More specifically the USCensus1990 data set was obtained from
   the USCensus1990raw data set by the following sequence of operations;
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    Randomization: The order of the cases in the original
      USCensus1990raw data set were randomly permuted.
</li>

<li>
    Selection of attributes: The 68 attributes included in the data
      set are given below. In the USCensus1990 data set we have
      added a single letter prefix to the original name. We add the
      letter 'i' to indicate that the original attribute values are
      used and 'd' to indicate that original attribute values for each
      case have been mapped to new values (the precise mapping is
      described below).

    Mapping: In this step we map all of the old values for variables
      with prefix 'd' to new values. The mappings for the variables
      dAncstry1, dAncstry2, dHispanic, dIndustry, dOccup, dPOB were
      designed to correspond to a natural coarsening of the original
      values based on the information in the file coding.htm. The
      remaining variables are continuous valued variables and the
      mapping for these variables was chosen to make variables that
      were fairly uniformly distributed across the states
      (quantiles). The precise mappings are specified in the file
      USCensus1990.mapping.sql. This file contains all of T-SQL
      procedures used to map the variables. These procedures can be
      used directly in SQLServer to map the original values or
      translated to some other language.
