<h4>Task : Scalable Clustering</h4>
<p>
Problem description: When clustering large data sets it is often not
necessary to use the entire data set to construct a clustering
model. Most clustering algorithms scale either linearly or
quadratically in the size of a data set. Thus, the run-times for
clustering methods can become burdensome when using large data sets.
Meek, Thiesson, and Heckerman (2001) provide a method for selecting
the number of points to use during the construction of a clustering
model and demonstrate the method can lead to substantial speedups
while obtaining clusters with comparable predictive power. Their
analysis is performed on several data sets including the
