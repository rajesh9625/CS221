<H1>Regulatory sites in yeast genome</H1>
<H2>Abstract</H2>
<p>
 The data consists of the upstream region for each gene in yeast.
 There are over 6000 genes in Yeast and the upstream regions are
 about 500 base pairs  long, ie. a sequence of characters from {A,C,T,G}.

This directory contains the upstream regions of every yeast gene.
<H2> Other Relevant Information</H2>
<P>
Representation of the data, as always, is crucial. Unfortunately
the best representation is not known, however one should maintain
as much of the biological knowledge/constraints as possible. In 
particular regulatory sites are strings of length 5-12 where
the base at a position is variability.
</P>
<H2> Data Characteristics</H2>
<P>
Data found by biological experiment. There may be some errors, but
probably less than 1%. No missing values.
</P>
<P>
Number of Instances:  6000+
</P>
<P>
Each instance is defined, in raw terms, by a sequence of
about between 400 and 1000 base pairs.
The belief is that patterns will have
length no larger than 12. One may introduce various
higher level features, which would change the number of attributes.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to identify patterns in the strings which are
common to specific family of genes and uncommon elsewhere.
There are various languages for describing the patterns which
permit expressing known constraints. One pattern language
is strings of length between 6 and 12 over {a,c,g,t}. Another
pattern language, which has been found to a better representation
of reality, is probability matrices of length 6 to 12.

<P>
   Paper adopts the language of strings of length 6 over {a,c,g,t} and
  shows that those strings that are occur more frequently than expected,
  match known regulatory elements. In particular they examine
  10 family of genes and find strings that partially match the known
  regulatory sites in most cases. Real regulatory regions are known
  to sometimes be longer than 6 and also know to have variability
  in their base pair constituency.
